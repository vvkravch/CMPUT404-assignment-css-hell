    <h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface"></a>Preface</h2>
    <p><span id="first">I</span>t is twenty years since I first determined to attempt the translation of
    <i>Faust</i>, in the original metres. At that time, although more than a score of
    English translations of the First Part, and three or four of the Second Part, were in
    existence, the experiment had not yet been made. The prose version of Hayward seemed
    to have been accepted as the standard, in default of anything more satisfactory: the
    English critics, generally sustaining the translator in his views concerning the
    secondary importance of form in Poetry, practically discouraged any further attempt;
    and no one, familiar with rhythmical expression through the needs of his own nature,
    had devoted the necessary love and patience to an adequate reproduction of the great
    work of Goethe's life.</p>
    <p>Mr. Brooks was the first to undertake the task, and the publication of his
    translation of the First Part (in 1856) induced me, for a time, to give up my own
    design. No previous English version exhibited such abnegation of the translator's own
    tastes and habits of thought, such reverent desire to present the original in its
    purest form. The care and conscience with which the work had been performed were so
    apparent, that I now state with reluctance what then seemed to me to be its only
    deficiencies,�a lack of the lyrical fire and fluency of the original in some
    passages, and an occasional lowering of the tone through the use of words which are
    literal, but not equivalent. The plan of translation adopted by Mr. Brooks was so
    entirely my own, that when further residence in Germany and a more careful study of
    both parts of <i>Faust</i> had satisfied me that the field was still open,�that
    the means furnished by the poetical affinity of the two languages had not yet been
    exhausted,�nothing remained for me but to follow him in all essential
    particulars. His example confirmed me in the belief that there were few difficulties
    in the way of a nearly literal yet thoroughly rhythmical version of <i>Faust</i>,
    which might not be overcome by loving labor. A comparison of seventeen English
    translations, in the arbitrary metres adopted by the translators, sufficiently showed
    the danger of allowing license in this respect: the white light of Goethe's thought
    was thereby passed through the tinted glass of other minds, and assumed the coloring
    of each. Moreover, the plea of selecting different metres in the hope of producing a
    similar effect is unreasonable, where the identical metres are possible.</p>
    <p>The value of form, in a poetical work, is the first question to be considered. No
    poet ever understood this question more thoroughly than Goethe himself, or expressed
    a more positive opinion in regard to it. The alternative modes of translation which
    he presents (reported by Riemer, quoted by Mrs. Austin, in her "Characteristics of
    Goethe," and accepted by Mr. Hayward),<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> are quite independent of his views
    concerning the value of form, which we find given elsewhere, in the clearest and most
    emphatic manner.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Poetry is not simply a fashion of expression: it is the form
    of expression absolutely required by a certain class of ideas. Poetry, indeed, may be
    distinguished from Prose by the single circumstance, that it is the utterance of
    whatever in man cannot be perfectly uttered in any other than a rhythmical form: it
    is useless to say that the naked meaning is independent of the form: on the contrary,
    the form contributes essentially to the fullness of the meaning. In Poetry which
    endures through its own inherent vitality, there is no forced union of these two
    elements. They are as intimately blended, and with the same mysterious beauty, as the
    sexes in the ancient Hermaphroditus. To attempt to represent Poetry in Prose, is very
    much like attempting to translate music into speech.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> "'There are two maxims of translation,' says he: 'the
      one requires that the author, of a foreign nation, be brought to us in such a
      manner that we may regard him as our own; the other, on the contrary, demands of us
      that we transport ourselves over to him, and adopt his situation, his mode of
      speaking, and his peculiarities. The advantages of both are sufficiently known to
      all instructed persons, from masterly examples.'" Is it necessary, however, that
      there should always be this alternative? Where the languages are kindred, and
      equally capable of all varieties of metrical expression, may not both these
      "maxims" be observed in the same translation? Goethe, it is true, was of the
      opinion that <i>Faust</i> ought to be given, in French, in the manner of Clement
      Marot; but this was undoubtedly because he felt the inadequacy of modern French to
      express the naive, simple realism of many passages. The same objection does not
      apply to English. There are a few archaic expressions in <i>Faust</i>, but no more
      than are still allowed�nay, frequently encouraged�in the English of our
      day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> "You are right," said Goethe; "there are great and
      mysterious agencies included in the various forms of Poetry. If the substance of my
      'Roman Elegies' were to be expressed in the tone and measure of Byron's 'Don Juan,'
      it would really have an atrocious effect."�<i>Eckermann</i>.</p>
      <p>"The rhythm," said Goethe, "is an unconscious result of the poetic mood. If one
      should stop to consider it mechanically, when about to write a poem, one would
      become bewildered and accomplish nothing of real poetical
      value."�<i>Ibid</i>.</p>
      <p>"<i>All that is poetic in character should be rythmically treated</i>! Such is
      my conviction; and if even a sort of poetic prose should be gradually introduced,
      it would only show that the distinction between prose and poetry had been
      completely lost sight of."�<i>Goethe to Schiller</i>, 1797.</p>
      <p>Tycho Mommsen, in his excellent essay, <i>Die Kunst des Deutschen Uebersetzers
      aus neueren Sprachen</i>, goes so far as to say: "The metrical or rhymed modelling
      of a poetical work is so essentially the germ of its being, that, rather than by
      giving it up, we might hope to construct a similar work of art before the eyes of
      our countrymen, by giving up or changing the substance. The immeasurable result
      which has followed works wherein the form has been retained�such as the Homer
      of Voss, and the Shakespeare of Tieck and Schlegel�is an incontrovertible
      evidence of the vitality of the endeavor."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> "Goethe's poems exercise a great sway over me, not
      only by their meaning, but also by their rhythm. It is a language which stimulates
      me to composition."�<i>Beethoven</i>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The various theories of translation from the Greek and Latin poets have been
    admirably stated by Dryden in his Preface to the "Translations from Ovid's Epistles,"
    and I do not wish to continue the endless discussion,�especially as our
    literature needs examples, not opinions. A recent expression, however, carries with
    it so much authority, that I feel bound to present some considerations which the
    accomplished scholar seems to have overlooked. Mr. Lewes<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> justly says:
    "The effect of poetry is a compound of music and suggestion; this music and this
    suggestion are intermingled in words, which to alter is to alter the effect. For
    words in poetry are not, as in prose, simple representatives of objects and ideas:
    they are parts of an organic whole,�they are tones in the harmony." He
    thereupon illustrates the effect of translation by changing certain well-known
    English stanzas into others, equivalent in meaning, but lacking their felicity of
    words, their grace and melody. I cannot accept this illustration as valid, because
    Mr. Lewes purposely omits the very quality which an honest translator should exhaust
    his skill in endeavoring to reproduce. He turns away from the <i>one best</i> word or
    phrase in the English lines he quotes, whereas the translator seeks precisely that
    one best word or phrase (having <i>all</i> the resources of his language at command),
    to represent what is said in <i>another</i> language. More than this, his task is not
    simply mechanical: he must feel, and be guided by, a secondary inspiration.
    Surrendering himself to the full possession of the spirit which shall speak through
    him, he receives, also, a portion of the same creative power. Mr. Lewes reaches this
    conclusion: "If, therefore, we reflect what a poem <i>Faust</i> is, and that it
    contains almost every variety of style and metre, it will be tolerably evident that
    no one unacquainted with the original can form an adequate idea of it from
    translation,"<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> which is certainly correct of any translation wherein
    something of the rhythmical variety and beauty of the original is not retained. That
    very much of the rhythmical character may be retained in English, was long ago shown
    by Mr. Carlyle,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> in the passages which he translated, both literally and
    rhythmically, from the <i>Helena</i> (Part Second). In fact, we have so many
    instances of the possibility of reciprocally transferring the finest qualities of
    English and German poetry, that there is no sufficient excuse for an unmetrical
    translation of <i>Faust</i>. I refer especially to such subtile and melodious lyrics
    as "The Castle by the Sea," of Uhland, and the "Silent Land" of Salis, translated by
    Mr. Longfellow; Goethe's "Minstrel" and "Coptic Song," by Dr. Hedge; Heine's "Two
    Grenadiers," by Dr. Furness and many of Heine's songs by Mr Leland; and also to the
    German translations of English lyrics, by Freiligrath and Strodtmann.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

      reader would perhaps best succeed who should first read Dr. Anster's brilliant
      paraphrase, and then carefully go through Hayward's prose translation." This is
      singularly at variance with the view he has just expressed. Dr. Anster's version is
      an almost incredible dilution of the original, written in <i>other</i> metres;
      while Hayward's entirely omits the element of poetry.</p>

    <p>I have a more serious objection, however, to urge against Mr. Hayward's prose
    translation. Where all the restraints of verse are flung aside, we should expect, at
    least, as accurate a reproduction of the sense, spirit, and tone of the original, as
    the genius of our language will permit. So far from having given us such a
    reproduction, Mr. Hayward not only occasionally mistakes the exact meaning of the
    German text,<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> but, wherever two phrases may be used to express the meaning
    with equal fidelity, he very frequently selects that which has the less grace,
    strength, or beauty.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

      der unbekannten Menge</i>, "My song sounds to the unknown multitude," is
      translated: "My <i>sorrow</i> voices itself to the strange throng." Other English
      translators, I notice, have followed Mr. Hayward in mistaking <i>Lied</i> for
      <i>Leid</i>.</p>

      <p><br>
       <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Bold is the endeavor,</span><br>
       <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Splendid the pay!</span><br>

       <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Noble the reward�</span><br>

    <p>For there are few things which may not be said, in English, in a twofold
    manner,�one poetic, and the other prosaic. In German, equally, a word which in
    ordinary use has a bare prosaic character may receive a fairer and finer quality from
    its place in verse. The prose translator should certainly be able to feel the
    manifestation of this law in both languages, and should so choose his words as to
    meet their reciprocal requirements. A man, however, who is not keenly sensible to the
    power and beauty and value of rhythm, is likely to overlook these delicate yet most
    necessary distinctions. The author's thought is stripped of a last grace in passing
    through his mind, and frequently presents very much the same resemblance to the
    original as an unhewn shaft to the fluted column. Mr. Hayward unconsciously
    illustrates his lack of a refined appreciation of verse, "in giving," as he says,
    "<i>a sort of rhythmical arrangement</i> to the lyrical parts," his object being "to
    convey some notion of the variety of versification which forms one great charm of the
    poem." A literal translation is always possible in the unrhymed passages; but even
    here Mr. Hayward's ear did not dictate to him the necessity of preserving the
    original rhythm.</p>
    <p>While, therefore, I heartily recognize his lofty appreciation of
    <i>Faust</i>,�while I honor him for the patient and conscientious labor he has
    bestowed upon his translation,�I cannot but feel that he has himself
    illustrated the unsoundness of his argument. Nevertheless, the circumstance that his
    prose translation of <i>Faust</i> has received so much acceptance proves those
    qualities of the original work which cannot be destroyed by a test so violent. From
    the cold bare outline thus produced, the reader unacquainted with the German language
    would scarcely guess what glow of color, what richness of changeful life, what fluent
    grace and energy of movement have been lost in the process. We must, of course,
    gratefully receive such an outline, where a nearer approach to the form of the
    original is impossible, but, until the latter has been demonstrated, we are wrong to
    remain content with the cheaper substitute.</p>
    <p>It seems to me that in all discussions upon this subject the capacities of the
    English language have received but scanty justice. The intellectual tendencies of our
    race have always been somewhat conservative, and its standards of literary taste or
    belief, once set up, are not varied without a struggle. The English ear is suspicious
    of new metres and unaccustomed forms of expression: there are critical detectives on
    the track of every author, and a violation of the accepted canons is followed by a
    summons to judgment. Thus the tendency is to contract rather than to expand the
    acknowledged excellences of the language.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

      following passage from Jacob Grimm: "No one of all the modern languages has
      acquired a greater force and strength than the English, through the derangement and
      relinquishment of its ancient laws of sound. The unteachable (nevertheless
      <i>learnable</i>) profusion of its middle-tones has conferred upon it an intrinsic
      power of expression, such as no other human tongue ever possessed. Its entire,
      thoroughly intellectual and wonderfully successful foundation and perfected
      development issued from a marvelous union of the two noblest tongues of Europe, the
      Germanic and the Romanic. Their mutual relation in the English language is well
      known, since the former furnished chiefly the material basis, while the latter
      added the intellectual conceptions. The English language, by and through which the
      greatest and most eminent poet of modern times�as contrasted with ancient
      classical poetry�(of course I can refer only to Shakespeare) was begotten and
      nourished, has a just claim to be called a language of the world; and it appears to
      be destined, like the English race, to a higher and broader sway in all quarters of
      the earth. For in richness, in compact adjustment of parts, and in pure
      intelligence, none of the living languages can be compared with it,�not even
      our German, which is divided even as we are divided, and which must cast off many
      imperfections before it can boldly enter on its career."�<i>Ueber den
      Ursprung der Sprache</i>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The difficulties in the way of a nearly literal translation of <i>Faust</i> in the
    original metres have been exaggerated, because certain affinities between the two
    languages have not been properly considered. With all the splendor of versification
    in the work, it contains but few metres of which the English tongue is not equally
    capable. Hood has familiarized us with dactylic (triple) rhymes, and they are
    remarkably abundant and skillful in Mr. Lowell's "Fable for the Critics": even the
    unrhymed iambic hexameter of the <i>Helena</i> occurs now and then in Milton's
    <i>Samson Agonistes</i>. It is true that the metrical foot into which the German
    language most naturally falls is the <i>trochaic</i>, while in English it is the
    <i>iambic</i>: it is true that German is rich, involved, and tolerant of new
    combinations, while English is simple, direct, and rather shy of compounds; but
    precisely these differences are so modified in the German of <i>Faust</i> that there
    is a mutual approach of the two languages. In <i>Faust</i>, the iambic measure
    predominates; the style is compact; the many licenses which the author allows himself
    are all directed towards a shorter mode of construction. On the other hand, English
    metre compels the use of inversions, admits many verbal liberties prohibited to
    prose, and so inclines towards various flexible features of its sister-tongue that
    many lines of <i>Faust</i> may be repeated in English without the slightest change of
    meaning, measure, or rhyme. There are words, it is true, with so delicate a bloom
    upon them that it can in no wise be preserved; but even such words will always lose
    less when they carry with them their rhythmical atmosphere. The flow of Goethe's
    verse is sometimes so similar to that of the corresponding English metre, that not
    only its harmonies and caesural pauses, but even its punctuation, may be easily
    retained.</p>
    <p>I am satisfied that the difference between a translation of <i>Faust</i> in prose
    or metre is chiefly one of labor,�and of that labor which is successful in
    proportion as it is joyously performed. My own task has been cheered by the
    discovery, that the more closely I reproduced the language of the original, the more
    of its rhythmical character was transferred at the same time. If, now and then, there
    was an inevitable alternative of meaning or music, I gave the preference to the
    former. By the term "original metres" I do not mean a rigid, unyielding adherence to
    every foot, line, and rhyme of the German original, although this has very nearly
    been accomplished. Since the greater part of the work is written in an irregular
    measure, the lines varying from three to six feet, and the rhymes arranged according
    to the author's will, I do not consider that an occasional change in the number of
    feet, or order of rhyme, is any violation of the metrical plan. The single slight
    liberty I have taken with the lyrical passages is in Margaret's song,�"The King
    of Thule,"�in which, by omitting the alternate feminine rhymes, yet retaining
    the metre, I was enabled to make the translation strictly literal. If, in two or
    three instances, I have left a line unrhymed, I have balanced the omission by giving
    rhymes to other lines which stand unrhymed in the original text. For the same reason,
    I make no apology for the imperfect rhymes, which are frequently a translation as
    well as a necessity. With all its supreme qualities, <i>Faust</i> is far from being a
    technically perfect work.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p><a name="Footnote_K_11" id="Footnote_K_11"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm#FNanchor_K_11"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> "At present, everything runs in technical grooves, and
      the critical gentlemen begin to wrangle whether in a rhyme an <i>s</i> should
      correspond with an <i>s</i> and not with <i>sz</i>. If I were young and reckless
      enough, I would purposely offend all such technical caprices: I would use
      alliteration, assonance, false rhyme, just according to my own will or
      convenience�but, at the same time, I would attend to the main thing, and
      endeavor to say so many good things that every one would be attracted to read and
      remember them."�<i>Goethe</i>, in 1831.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The feminine and dactylic rhymes, which have been for the most part omitted by all
    metrical translators except Mr. Brooks, are indispensable. The characteristic tone of
    many passages would be nearly lost, without them. They give spirit and grace to the
    dialogue, point to the aphoristic portions (especially in the Second Part), and an
    ever-changing music to the lyrical passages. The English language, though not so rich
    as the German in such rhymes, is less deficient than is generally supposed. The
    difficulty to be overcome is one of construction rather than of the vocabulary. The
    present participle can only be used to a limited extent, on account of its weak
    termination, and the want of an accusative form to the noun also restricts the
    arrangement of words in English verse. I cannot hope to have been always successful;
    but I have at least labored long and patiently, bearing constantly in mind not only
    the meaning of the original and the mechanical structure of the lines, but also that
    subtile and haunting music which seems to govern rhythm instead of being governed by
    it.</p>

     And with tremendous, oft-repeated urging,<br>
     Squeeze onward through the narrow gate of grace:<br>
     By daylight even, they push and cram in<br>

     Idly to us they come, as to a masquerade,<br>
     Mere curiosity their spirits warming:<br>
     The ladies with themselves, and with their finery, aid,<br>
     Without a salary their parts performing.<br>
     What dreams are yours in high poetic places?<br>
     You're pleased, forsooth, full houses to behold?<br>
     Draw near, and view your patrons' faces!<br>
     The half are coarse, the half are cold.<br>
     One, when the play is out, goes home to cards;<br>
     A wild night on a wench's breast another chooses:<br>
     Why should you rack, poor, foolish bards,<br>
     For ends like these, the gracious Muses?<br>
     I tell you, give but more�more, ever more, they ask:<br>
     Thus shall you hit the mark of gain and glory.<br>
     Seek to confound your auditory!<br>
     To satisfy them is a task.�<br>
     What ails you now? Is't suffering, or pleasure?<br>
    <br>
     POET<br>
    <br>
     Go, find yourself a more obedient slave!<br>
     What! shall the Poet that which Nature gave,<br>
     The highest right, supreme Humanity,<br>
     Forfeit so wantonly, to swell your treasure?<br>
     Whence o'er the heart his empire free?<br>
     The elements of Life how conquers he?<br>
     Is't not his heart's accord, urged outward far and dim,<br>
     To wind the world in unison with him?<br>
     When on the spindle, spun to endless distance,<br>
     By Nature's listless hand the thread is twirled,<br>
     And the discordant tones of all existence<br>
     In sullen jangle are together hurled,<br>
     Who, then, the changeless orders of creation<br>
     Divides, and kindles into rhythmic dance?<br>
     Who brings the One to join the general ordination,<br>
     Where it may throb in grandest consonance?<br>
     Who bids the storm to passion stir the bosom?<br>
     In brooding souls the sunset burn above?<br>
     Who scatters every fairest April blossom<br>
     Along the shining path of Love?<br>
     Who braids the noteless leaves to crowns, requiting<br>
     Desert with fame, in Action's every field?<br>
     Who makes Olympus sure, the Gods uniting?<br>
     The might of Man, as in the Bard revealed.<br>
    <br>
     MERRY-ANDREW<br>
    <br>
     So, these fine forces, in conjunction,<br>
     Propel the high poetic function,<br>
     As in a love-adventure they might play!<br>
     You meet by accident; you feel, you stay,<br>
     And by degrees your heart is tangled;<br>
     Bliss grows apace, and then its course is jangled;<br>
     You're ravished quite, then comes a touch of woe,<br>
     And there's a neat romance, completed ere you know!<br>
     Let us, then, such a drama give!<br>
     Grasp the exhaustless life that all men live!<br>
     Each shares therein, though few may comprehend:<br>
     Where'er you touch, there's interest without end.<br>
     In motley pictures little light,<br>
     Much error, and of truth a glimmering mite,<br>
     Thus the best beverage is supplied,<br>
     Whence all the world is cheered and edified.<br>
     Then, at your play, behold the fairest flower<br>
     Of youth collect, to hear the revelation!<br>
     Each tender soul, with sentimental power,<br>
     Sucks melancholy food from your creation;<br>
     And now in this, now that, the leaven works.<br>
     For each beholds what in his bosom lurks.<br>
     They still are moved at once to weeping or to laughter,<br>
     Still wonder at your flights, enjoy the show they see:<br>
     A mind, once formed, is never suited after;<br>
     One yet in growth will ever grateful be.<br>
    <br>
     POET<br>
    <br>
     Then give me back that time of pleasures,<br>
     While yet in joyous growth I sang,�<br>
     When, like a fount, the crowding measures<br>
     Uninterrupted gushed and sprang!<br>
     Then bright mist veiled the world before me,<br>
     In opening buds a marvel woke,<br>
     As I the thousand blossoms broke,<br>
     Which every valley richly bore me!<br>
     I nothing had, and yet enough for youth�<br>
     Joy in Illusion, ardent thirst for Truth.<br>
     Give, unrestrained, the old emotion,<br>
     The bliss that touched the verge of pain,<br>
     The strength of Hate, Love's deep devotion,�<br>
     O, give me back my youth again!<br>
    <br>
     MERRY ANDREW<br>
    <br>
     Youth, good my friend, you certainly require<br>
     When foes in combat sorely press you;<br>
     When lovely maids, in fond desire,<br>
     Hang on your bosom and caress you;<br>
     When from the hard-won goal the wreath<br>
     Beckons afar, the race awaiting;<br>
     When, after dancing out your breath,<br>
     You pass the night in dissipating:�<br>
     But that familiar harp with soul<br>
     To play,�with grace and bold expression,<br>
     And towards a self-erected goal<br>
     To walk with many a sweet digression,�<br>
     This, aged Sirs, belongs to you,<br>
     And we no less revere you for that reason:<br>
     Age childish makes, they say, but 'tis not true;<br>
     We're only genuine children still, in Age's season!<br>
    <br>
    <br>
     MANAGER<br>
    <br>
     The words you've bandied are sufficient;<br>
     'Tis deeds that I prefer to see:<br>
     In compliments you're both proficient,<br>
     But might, the while, more useful be.<br>
     What need to talk of Inspiration?<br>
     'Tis no companion of Delay.<br>
     If Poetry be your vocation,<br>
     Let Poetry your will obey!<br>
     Full well you know what here is wanting;<br>
     The crowd for strongest drink is panting,<br>
     And such, forthwith, I'd have you brew.<br>
     What's left undone to-day, To-morrow will not do.<br>
     Waste not a day in vain digression:<br>
     With resolute, courageous trust<br>
     Seize every possible impression,<br>
     And make it firmly your possession;<br>
     You'll then work on, because you must.<br>
     Upon our German stage, you know it,<br>
     Each tries his hand at what he will;<br>
     So, take of traps and scenes your fill,<br>
     And all you find, be sure to show it!<br>
     Use both the great and lesser heavenly light,�<br>
     Squander the stars in any number,<br>
     Beasts, birds, trees, rocks, and all such lumber,<br>
     Fire, water, darkness, Day and Night!<br>
     Thus, in our booth's contracted sphere,<br>
     The circle of Creation will appear,<br>
     And move, as we deliberately impel,<br>
     From Heaven, across the World, to Hell!<br>

     'Mid brother-spheres, his ancient round:<br>

     The awful Night's intense profound:<br>
     The ocean-tides in foam are breaking,<br>

     MICHAEL<br>

     And rival storms abroad are surging<br>
     From sea to land, from land to sea.<br>
     A chain of deepest action forging<br>
     Round all, in wrathful energy.<br>
     There flames a desolation, blazing<br>
     Before the Thunder's crashing way:<br>
     Yet, Lord, Thy messengers are praising<br>
     The gentle movement of Thy Day.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     THE THREE<br>

     Though still by them uncomprehended,<br>
     From these the angels draw their power,<br>

     <br>
     MEPHISTOPHELES<br>
     <br>
     Since Thou, O Lord, deign'st to approach again<br>
     And ask us how we do, in manner kindest,<br>
     And heretofore to meet myself wert fain,<br>
     Among Thy menials, now, my face Thou findest.<br>
     Pardon, this troop I cannot follow after<br>
     With lofty speech, though by them scorned and spurned:<br>
     My pathos certainly would move Thy laughter,<br>
     If Thou hadst not all merriment unlearned.<br>
     Of suns and worlds I've nothing to be quoted;<br>
     How men torment themselves, is all I've noted.<br>
     The little god o' the world sticks to the same old way,<br>
     And is as whimsical as on Creation's day.<br>
     Life somewhat better might content him,<br>
     But for the gleam of heavenly light which Thou hast lent<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">him:</span><br>
     He calls it Reason�thence his power's increased,<br>
     To be far beastlier than any beast.<br>
     Saving Thy Gracious Presence, he to me<br>
     A long-legged grasshopper appears to be,<br>
     That springing flies, and flying springs,<br>
     And in the grass the same old ditty sings.<br>
     Would he still lay among the grass he grows in!<br>
     Each bit of dung he seeks, to stick his nose in.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     THE LORD<br>
     <br>
     Hast thou, then, nothing more to mention?<br>
     Com'st ever, thus, with ill intention?<br>

     No, Lord! I find things, there, still bad as they can be.<br>
     Man's misery even to pity moves my nature;<br>
     I've scarce the heart to plague the wretched creature.<br>

     Forsooth! He serves you after strange devices:<br>
     No earthly meat or drink the fool suffices:<br>
     His spirit's ferment far aspireth;<br>
     Half conscious of his frenzied, crazed unrest,<br>
     The fairest stars from Heaven he requireth,<br>
     From Earth the highest raptures and the best,<br>
     And all the Near and Far that he desireth<br>
     Fails to subdue the tumult of his breast.<br>

     <br>
     <br>
     MEPHISTOPHELES<br>
     <br>
     What will you bet? There's still a chance to gain him,<br>
     If unto me full leave you give,<br>
     Gently upon <i>my</i> road to train him!<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     THE LORD<br>
     <br>
     As long as he on earth shall live,<br>
     So long I make no prohibition.<br>

     He cannot choose but err.<br>

     MEPHISTOPHELES<br>
     <br>
     My thanks! I find the dead no acquisition,<br>
     And never cared to have them in my keeping.<br>
     I much prefer the cheeks where ruddy blood is leaping,<br>
     And when a corpse approaches, close my house:<br>
     It goes with me, as with the cat the mouse.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     THE LORD<br>
     <br>
     Enough! What thou hast asked is granted.<br>
     Turn off this spirit from his fountain-head;<br>
     To trap him, let thy snares be planted,<br>
     And him, with thee, be downward led;<br>
     Then stand abashed, when thou art forced to say:<br>
     A good man, through obscurest aspiration,<br>
     Has still an instinct of the one true way.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     MEPHISTOPHELES<br>
     <br>
     Agreed! But 'tis a short probation.<br>
     About my bet I feel no trepidation.<br>
     If I fulfill my expectation,<br>
     You'll let me triumph with a swelling breast:<br>
     Dust shall he eat, and with a zest,<br>
     As did a certain snake, my near relation.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     THE LORD<br>
     <br>
     Therein thou'rt free, according to thy merits;<br>
     The like of thee have never moved My hate.<br>
     Of all the bold, denying Spirits,<br>
     The waggish knave least trouble doth create.<br>
     Man's active nature, flagging, seeks too soon the level;<br>
     Unqualified repose he learns to crave;<br>
     Whence, willingly, the comrade him I gave,<br>
     Who works, excites, and must create, as Devil.<br>
     But ye, God's sons in love and duty,<br>
     Enjoy the rich, the ever-living Beauty!<br>
     Creative Power, that works eternal schemes,<br>
     Clasp you in bonds of love, relaxing never,<br>
     And what in wavering apparition gleams<br>
     Fix in its place with thoughts that stand forever!<br>

     So humanly to gossip with the Devil!<br>

     <br>
    <span id="first">I</span>'ve studied now Philosophy<br>
     And Jurisprudence, Medicine,�<br>
     And even, alas! Theology,�<br>
     From end to end, with labor keen;<br>

     I stand, no wiser than before:<br>
     I'm Magister�yea, Doctor�hight,<br>
     And straight or cross-wise, wrong or right,<br>
     These ten years long, with many woes,<br>
     I've led my scholars by the nose,�<br>
     And see, that nothing can be known!<br>
     <i>That</i> knowledge cuts me to the bone.<br>
     I'm cleverer, true, than those fops of teachers,<br>
     Doctors and Magisters, Scribes and Preachers;<br>
     Neither scruples nor doubts come now to smite me,<br>
     Nor Hell nor Devil can longer affright me.<br>
     <br>
     For this, all pleasure am I foregoing;<br>
     I do not pretend to aught worth knowing,<br>
     I do not pretend I could be a teacher<br>
     To help or convert a fellow-creature.<br>
     Then, too, I've neither lands nor gold,<br>
     Nor the world's least pomp or honor hold�<br>
     No dog would endure such a curst existence!<br>
     Wherefore, from Magic I seek assistance,<br>
     That many a secret perchance I reach<br>
     Through spirit-power and spirit-speech,<br>
     And thus the bitter task forego<br>
     Of saying the things I do not know,�<br>
     That I may detect the inmost force<br>
     Which binds the world, and guides its course;<br>
     Its germs, productive powers explore,<br>
     And rummage in empty words no more!<br>

     O full and splendid Moon, whom I<br>
     Have, from this desk, seen climb the sky<br>
     So many a midnight,�would thy glow<br>
     For the last time beheld my woe!<br>
     Ever thine eye, most mournful friend,<br>
     O'er books and papers saw me bend;<br>
     But would that I, on mountains grand,<br>
     Amid thy blessed light could stand,<br>
     With spirits through mountain-caverns hover,<br>
     Float in thy twilight the meadows over,<br>
     And, freed from the fumes of lore that swathe me,<br>
     To health in thy dewy fountains bathe me!<br>
     <br>
     Ah, me! this dungeon still I see.<br>
     This drear, accursed masonry,<br>
     Where even the welcome daylight strains<br>
     But duskly through the painted panes.<br>
     Hemmed in by many a toppling heap<br>
     Of books worm-eaten, gray with dust,<br>
     Which to the vaulted ceiling creep,<br>
     Against the smoky paper thrust,�<br>
     With glasses, boxes, round me stacked,<br>
     And instruments together hurled,<br>
     Ancestral lumber, stuffed and packed�<br>
     Such is my world: and what a world!<br>
     <br>
     And do I ask, wherefore my heart<br>
     Falters, oppressed with unknown needs?<br>
     Why some inexplicable smart<br>
     All movement of my life impedes?<br>
     Alas! in living Nature's stead,<br>
     Where God His human creature set,<br>
     In smoke and mould the fleshless dead<br>
     And bones of beasts surround me yet!<br>
     <br>
     Fly! Up, and seek the broad, free land!<br>
     And this one Book of Mystery<br>
     From Nostradamus' very hand,<br>
     Is't not sufficient company?<br>
     When I the starry courses know,<br>
     And Nature's wise instruction seek,<br>
     With light of power my soul shall glow,<br>
     As when to spirits spirits speak.<br>
     Tis vain, this empty brooding here,<br>
     Though guessed the holy symbols be:<br>

     I feel a youthful, holy, vital bliss<br>
     In every vein and fibre newly glowing.<br>
     Was it a God, who traced this sign,<br>
     With calm across my tumult stealing,<br>
     My troubled heart to joy unsealing,<br>
     With impulse, mystic and divine,<br>
     The powers of Nature here, around my path, revealing?<br>
     Am I a God?�so clear mine eyes!<br>
     In these pure features I behold<br>
     Creative Nature to my soul unfold.<br>
     What says the sage, now first I recognize:<br>
     "The spirit-world no closures fasten;<br>
     Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead:<br>

     To bathe thy breast in morning-red!"<br>
     <br>
     (<i>He contemplates the sign</i>.)<br>
     <br>
     How each the Whole its substance gives,<br>
     Each in the other works and lives!<br>
     Like heavenly forces rising and descending,<br>
     Their golden urns reciprocally lending,<br>
     With wings that winnow blessing<br>
     From Heaven through Earth I see them pressing,<br>
     Filling the All with harmony unceasing!<br>
     How grand a show! but, ah! a show alone.<br>
     Thee, boundless Nature, how make thee my own?<br>
     Where you, ye beasts? Founts of all Being, shining,<br>
     Whereon hang Heaven's and Earth's desire,<br>
     Whereto our withered hearts aspire,�<br>
     Ye flow, ye feed: and am I vainly pining?<br>

     The moon conceals her light�<br>

     Around my head!�There falls<br>
     A horror from the vaulted roof,<br>
     And seizes me!<br>
     I feel thy presence, Spirit I invoke!<br>
     Reveal thyself!<br>
     Ha! in my heart what rending stroke!<br>
     With new impulsion<br>
     My senses heave in this convulsion!<br>

     You cook the scraps from others' fare;<br>
     And from your heap of ashes hatching<br>
     A starveling flame, ye blow it bare!<br>
     Take children's, monkeys' gaze admiring,<br>

    <p>FAUST AND WAGNER</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Released from ice are brook and river<br>
     By the quickening glance of the gracious Spring;<br>
     The colors of hope to the valley cling,<br>
     And weak old Winter himself must shiver,<br>
     Withdrawn to the mountains, a crownless king:<br>
     Whence, ever retreating, he sends again<br>
     Impotent showers of sleet that darkle<br>
     In belts across the green o' the plain.<br>
     But the sun will permit no white to sparkle;<br>
     Everywhere form in development moveth;<br>
     He will brighten the world with the tints he loveth,<br>
     And, lacking blossoms, blue, yellow, and red,<br>
     He takes these gaudy people instead.<br>
     Turn thee about, and from this height<br>
     Back on the town direct thy sight.<br>
     Out of the hollow, gloomy gate,<br>
     The motley throngs come forth elate:<br>
     Each will the joy of the sunshine hoard,<br>
     To honor the Day of the Risen Lord!<br>
     They feel, themselves, their resurrection:<br>
     From the low, dark rooms, scarce habitable;<br>
     From the bonds of Work, from Trade's restriction;<br>
     From the pressing weight of roof and gable;<br>
     From the narrow, crushing streets and alleys;<br>
     From the churches' solemn and reverend night,<br>
     All come forth to the cheerful light.<br>
     How lively, see! the multitude sallies,<br>
     Scattering through gardens and fields remote,<br>
     While over the river, that broadly dallies,<br>
     Dances so many a festive boat;<br>
     And overladen, nigh to sinking,<br>
     The last full wherry takes the stream.<br>
     Yonder afar, from the hill-paths blinking,<br>
     Their clothes are colors that softly gleam.<br>
     I hear the noise of the village, even;<br>
     Here is the People's proper Heaven;<br>
     Here high and low contented see!<br>
     Here I am Man,�dare man to be!</p>
    <p>WAGNER</p>
    <p>To stroll with you, Sir Doctor, flatters;<br>
     'Tis honor, profit, unto me.<br>
     But I, alone, would shun these shallow matters,<br>
     Since all that's coarse provokes my enmity.<br>
     This fiddling, shouting, ten-pin rolling<br>
     I hate,�these noises of the throng:<br>
     They rave, as Satan were their sports controlling.<br>
     And call it mirth, and call it song!</p>
    PEASANTS, UNDER THE LINDEN-TREE<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>Dance and Song</i>.)</span><br>

    <p><span style="margin-left: 5em;">All for the dance the shepherd
    dressed,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">In ribbons, wreath, and gayest vest</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Himself with care arraying:</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Around the linden lass and lad</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Already footed it like mad:</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Hurrah! hurrah!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Hurrah�tarara-la!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">The fiddle-bow was playing.</span><br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">He broke the ranks, no whit afraid,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">And with his elbow punched a maid,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Who stood, the dance surveying:</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">The buxom wench, she turned and said:</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">"Now, you I call a stupid-head!"</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Hurrah! hurrah!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Hurrah�tarara-la!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">"Be decent while you're staying!"</span><br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Then round the circle went their
    flight,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">They danced to left, they danced to
    right:</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Their kirtles all were playing.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">They first grew red, and then grew
    warm,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">And rested, panting, arm in arm,�</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Hurrah! hurrah!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Hurrah�tarara-la!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">And hips and elbows straying.</span><br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Now, don't be so familiar here!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">How many a one has fooled his dear,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Waylaying and betraying!</span><br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">And yet, he coaxed her soon aside,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">And round the linden sounded wide.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Hurrah! hurrah!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Hurrah�tarara-la!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 5em;">And the fiddle-bow was playing.</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>OLD PEASANT</p>
    <p>Sir Doctor, it is good of you,<br>
     That thus you condescend, to-day,<br>
     Among this crowd of merry folk,<br>
     A highly-learned man, to stray.<br>
     Then also take the finest can,<br>
     We fill with fresh wine, for your sake:<br>
     I offer it, and humbly wish<br>
     That not alone your thirst is slake,�<br>
     That, as the drops below its brink,<br>
     So many days of life you drink!</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>I take the cup you kindly reach,<br>
     With thanks and health to all and each.</p>
    <p>(<i>The People gather in a circle about him</i>.)</p>
    <p>OLD PEASANT</p>
    <p>In truth, 'tis well and fitly timed,<br>
     That now our day of joy you share,<br>
     Who heretofore, in evil days,<br>
     Gave us so much of helping care.<br>
     Still many a man stands living here,<br>
     Saved by your father's skillful hand,<br>
     That snatched him from the fever's rage<br>
     And stayed the plague in all the land.<br>
     Then also you, though but a youth,<br>
     Went into every house of pain:<br>
     Many the corpses carried forth,<br>
     But you in health came out again.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>No test or trial you evaded:<br>
     A Helping God the helper aided.</p>
    <p>ALL</p>
    <p>Health to the man, so skilled and tried.<br>
     That for our help he long may abide!</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>To Him above bow down, my friends,<br>
     Who teaches help, and succor sends!</p>
    <p>(<i>He goes on with</i> WAGNER.)</p>
    <p>WAGNER</p>
    <p>With what a feeling, thou great man, must thou<br>
     Receive the people's honest veneration!<br>
     How lucky he, whose gifts his station<br>
     With such advantages endow!<br>
     Thou'rt shown to all the younger generation:<br>
     Each asks, and presses near to gaze;<br>
     The fiddle stops, the dance delays.<br>
     Thou goest, they stand in rows to see,<br>
     And all the caps are lifted high;<br>
     A little more, and they would bend the knee<br>
     As if the Holy Host came by.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>A few more steps ascend, as far as yonder stone!�<br>
     Here from our wandering will we rest contented.<br>
     Here, lost in thought, I've lingered oft alone,<br>
     When foolish fasts and prayers my life tormented.<br>
     Here, rich in hope and firm in faith,<br>
     With tears, wrung hands and sighs, I've striven,<br>
     The end of that far-spreading death<br>
     Entreating from the Lord of Heaven!<br>
     Now like contempt the crowd's applauses seem:<br>
     Couldst thou but read, within mine inmost spirit,<br>
     How little now I deem,<br>
     That sire or son such praises merit!<br>
     My father's was a sombre, brooding brain,<br>
     Which through the holy spheres of Nature groped and wandered,<br>
     And honestly, in his own fashion, pondered<br>
     With labor whimsical, and pain:<br>
     Who, in his dusky work-shop bending,<br>
     With proved adepts in company,<br>
     Made, from his recipes unending,<br>
     Opposing substances agree.<br>
     There was a Lion red, a wooer daring,<br>
     Within the Lily's tepid bath espoused,<br>
     And both, tormented then by flame unsparing,<br>
     By turns in either bridal chamber housed.<br>
     If then appeared, with colors splendid,<br>
     The young Queen in her crystal shell,<br>
     This was the medicine�the patients' woes soon ended,<br>
     And none demanded: who got well?<br>
     Thus we, our hellish boluses compounding,<br>
     Among these vales and hills surrounding,<br>
     Worse than the pestilence, have passed.<br>
     Thousands were done to death from poison of my giving;<br>
     And I must hear, by all the living,<br>
     The shameless murderers praised at last!</p>
    <p>WAGNER</p>
    <p>Why, therefore, yield to such depression?<br>
     A good man does his honest share<br>
     In exercising, with the strictest care,<br>
     The art bequeathed to his possession!<br>
     Dost thou thy father honor, as a youth?<br>
     Then may his teaching cheerfully impel thee:<br>
     Dost thou, as man, increase the stores of truth?<br>
     Then may thine own son afterwards excel thee.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>O happy he, who still renews<br>
     The hope, from Error's deeps to rise forever!<br>
     That which one does not know, one needs to use;<br>
     And what one knows, one uses never.<br>
     But let us not, by such despondence, so<br>
     The fortune of this hour embitter!<br>
     Mark how, beneath the evening sunlight's glow,<br>
     The green-embosomed houses glitter!<br>
     The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;<br>
     It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;<br>
     Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil,<br>
     Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!<br>
     Then would I see eternal Evening gild<br>
     The silent world beneath me glowing,<br>
     On fire each mountain-peak, with peace each valley filled,<br>
     The silver brook to golden rivers flowing.<br>
     The mountain-chain, with all its gorges deep,<br>
     Would then no more impede my godlike motion;<br>
     And now before mine eyes expands the ocean<br>
     With all its bays, in shining sleep!<br>
     Yet, finally, the weary god is sinking;<br>
     The new-born impulse fires my mind,�<br>
     I hasten on, his beams eternal drinking,<br>
     The Day before me and the Night behind,<br>
     Above me heaven unfurled, the floor of waves beneath me,�<br>
     A glorious dream! though now the glories fade.<br>
     Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aid<br>
     Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me.<br>
     Yet in each soul is born the pleasure<br>
     Of yearning onward, upward and away,<br>
     When o'er our heads, lost in the vaulted azure,<br>
     The lark sends down his flickering lay,�<br>
     When over crags and piny highlands<br>
     The poising eagle slowly soars,<br>
     And over plains and lakes and islands<br>
     The crane sails by to other shores.</p>
    <p>WAGNER</p>
    <p>I've had, myself, at times, some odd caprices,<br>
     But never yet such impulse felt, as this is.<br>
     One soon fatigues, on woods and fields to look,<br>
     Nor would I beg the bird his wing to spare us:<br>
     How otherwise the mental raptures bear us<br>
     From page to page, from book to book!<br>
     Then winter nights take loveliness untold,<br>
     As warmer life in every limb had crowned you;<br>
     And when your hands unroll some parchment rare and old,<br>
     All Heaven descends, and opens bright around you!</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>One impulse art thou conscious of, at best;<br>
     O, never seek to know the other!<br>
     Two souls, alas! reside within my breast,<br>
     And each withdraws from, and repels, its brother.<br>
     One with tenacious organs holds in love<br>
     And clinging lust the world in its embraces;<br>
     The other strongly sweeps, this dust above,<br>
     Into the high ancestral spaces.<br>
     If there be airy spirits near,<br>
     'Twixt Heaven and Earth on potent errands fleeing,<br>
     Let them drop down the golden atmosphere,<br>
     And bear me forth to new and varied being!<br>
     Yea, if a magic mantle once were mine,<br>
     To waft me o'er the world at pleasure,<br>
     I would not for the costliest stores of treasure�<br>
     Not for a monarch's robe�the gift resign.</p>
    <p>WAGNER</p>
    <p>Invoke not thus the well-known throng,<br>
     Which through the firmament diffused is faring,<br>
     And danger thousand-fold, our race to wrong.<br>
     In every quarter is preparing.<br>
     Swift from the North the spirit-fangs so sharp<br>
     Sweep down, and with their barb�d points assail you;<br>
     Then from the East they come, to dry and warp<br>
     Your lungs, till breath and being fail you:<br>
     If from the Desert sendeth them the South,<br>
     With fire on fire your throbbing forehead crowning,<br>
     The West leads on a host, to cure the drouth<br>
     Only when meadow, field, and you are drowning.<br>
     They gladly hearken, prompt for injury,�<br>
     Gladly obey, because they gladly cheat us;<br>
     From Heaven they represent themselves to be,<br>
     And lisp like angels, when with lies they meet us.<br>
     But, let us go! 'Tis gray and dusky all:<br>
     The air is cold, the vapors fall.<br>
     At night, one learns his house to prize:�<br>
     Why stand you thus, with such astonished eyes?<br>
     What, in the twilight, can your mind so trouble?</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Seest thou the black dog coursing there, through corn and<br>
     stubble?</p>
    <p>WAGNER</p>
    <p>Long since: yet deemed him not important in the least.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Inspect him close: for what tak'st thou the beast?</p>
    <p>WAGNER</p>
    <p>Why, for a poodle who has lost his master,<br>
     And scents about, his track to find.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Seest thou the spiral circles, narrowing faster,<br>
     Which he, approaching, round us seems to wind?<br>
     A streaming trail of fire, if I see rightly,<br>
     Follows his path of mystery.</p>
    <p>WAGNER</p>
    <p>It may be that your eyes deceive you slightly;<br>
     Naught but a plain black poodle do I see.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>It seems to me that with enchanted cunning<br>
     He snares our feet, some future chain to bind.</p>
    <p>WAGNER</p>
    <p>I see him timidly, in doubt, around us running,<br>
     Since, in his master's stead, two strangers doth he find.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>The circle narrows: he is near!</p>
    <p>WAGNER</p>
    <p>A dog thou seest, and not a phantom, here!<br>
     Behold him stop�upon his belly crawl�His<br>
     tail set wagging: canine habits, all!</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Come, follow us! Come here, at least!</p>
    <p>WAGNER</p>
    <p>'Tis the absurdest, drollest beast.<br>
     Stand still, and you will see him wait;<br>
     Address him, and he gambols straight;<br>
     If something's lost, he'll quickly bring it,�<br>
     Your cane, if in the stream you fling it.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>No doubt you're right: no trace of mind, I own,<br>
     Is in the beast: I see but drill, alone.</p>
    <p>WAGNER</p>
    <p>The dog, when he's well educated,<br>
     Is by the wisest tolerated.<br>
     Yes, he deserves your favor thoroughly,�<br>
     The clever scholar of the students, he!</p>

     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Within whose dread and holy keeping</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The better soul awakes to light.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The wild desires no longer win us,</span><br>

     As thou, up yonder, with running and leaping<br>
     Amused us hast, on the mountain's crest,<br>

    <p>So now I take thee into my keeping,<br>
     A welcome, but also a silent, guest.</p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Ah, when, within our narrow chamber</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The lamp with friendly lustre glows,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Flames in the breast each faded
    ember,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And in the heart, itself that knows.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Then Hope again lends sweet

     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The very founts of Life, to reach.</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>Snarl not, poodle! To the sound that rises,<br>
     The sacred tones that my soul embrace,<br>
     This bestial noise is out of place.<br>
     We are used to see, that Man despises<br>
     What he never comprehends,<br>
     And the Good and the Beautiful vilipends,<br>
     Finding them often hard to measure:<br>
     Will the dog, like man, snarl <i>his</i> displeasure?</p>
    <p>But ah! I feel, though will thereto be stronger,<br>
     Contentment flows from out my breast no longer.<br>
     Why must the stream so soon run dry and fail us,<br>
     And burning thirst again assail us?<br>
     Therein I've borne so much probation!<br>
     And yet, this want may be supplied us;<br>
     We call the Supernatural to guide us;<br>
     We pine and thirst for Revelation,<br>
     Which nowhere worthier is, more nobly sent,<br>
     Than here, in our New Testament.<br>
     I feel impelled, its meaning to determine,�<br>
     With honest purpose, once for all,<br>
     The hallowed Original<br>
     To change to my beloved German.<br>
    </p>
    <p>(<i>He opens a volume, and commences</i>.)<br>

     Here am I balked: who, now can help afford?<br>
     The <i>Word?</i>�impossible so high to rate it;<br>
     And otherwise must I translate it.<br>
     If by the Spirit I am truly taught.<br>
     Then thus: "In the Beginning was the <i>Thought</i>"<br>
     This first line let me weigh completely,<br>
     Lest my impatient pen proceed too fleetly.<br>
     Is it the <i>Thought</i> which works, creates, indeed?<br>
     "In the Beginning was the <i>Power,"</i> I read.<br>
     Yet, as I write, a warning is suggested,<br>
     That I the sense may not have fairly tested.<br>
     The Spirit aids me: now I see the light!<br>
     "In the Beginning was the <i>Act</i>," I write.<br>
    <br>
     If I must share my chamber with thee,<br>
     Poodle, stop that howling, prithee!<br>
     Cease to bark and bellow!<br>
     Such a noisy, disturbing fellow<br>
     I'll no longer suffer near me.<br>

     Must leave, I fear me.<br>
     No longer guest-right I bestow;<br>

     Is that in the course of nature?<br>
     Is't actual fact? or Fancy's shows?<br>
     How long and broad my poodle grows!<br>
     He rises mightily:<br>
     A canine form that cannot be!<br>
     What a spectre I've harbored thus!<br>
     He resembles a hippopotamus,<br>
     With fiery eyes, teeth terrible to see:<br>
     O, now am I sure of thee!<br>
     For all of thy half-hellish brood<br>
     The Key of Solomon is good.<br>

    <p>SPIRITS (<i>in the corridor</i>)</p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Some one, within, is caught!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Stay without, follow him not!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Like the fox in a snare,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Quakes the old hell-lynx there.</span><br>

     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Back and forth hover,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Under and over,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And he'll work himself out.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">If your aid avail him,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Let it not fail him;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">For he, without measure,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Has wrought for our pleasure.</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>First, to encounter the beast,<br>
     The Words of the Four be addressed:<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Salamander, shine glorious!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wave, Undine, as bidden!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sylph, be thou hidden!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gnome, be laborious!</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>Who knows not their sense<br>
     (These elements),�<br>
     Their properties<br>
     And power not sees,�<br>
     No mastery he inherits<br>
     Over the Spirits.</p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Vanish in flaming ether,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Salamander!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Flow foamingly together,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Undine!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Shine in meteor-sheen,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Sylph!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Bring help to hearth and shelf.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Incubus! Incubus!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Step forward, and finish thus!</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>Of the Four, no feature<br>
     Lurks in the creature.<br>
     Quiet he lies, and grins disdain:<br>
     Not yet, it seems, have I given him pain.<br>
     Now, to undisguise thee,<br>
     Hear me exorcise thee!<br>
     Art thou, my gay one,<br>
     Hell's fugitive stray-one?<br>
     The sign witness now,<br>
     Before which they bow,<br>
     The cohorts of Hell!</p>
    <p>With hair all bristling, it begins to swell.</p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Base Being, hearest thou?</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Knowest and fearest thou</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The One, unoriginate,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Named inexpressibly,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Through all Heaven impermeate,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Pierced irredressibly!</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>Behind the stove still banned,<br>
     See it, an elephant, expand!<br>
     It fills the space entire,<br>
     Mist-like melting, ever faster.<br>
     'Tis enough: ascend no higher,�<br>
     Lay thyself at the feet of the Master!<br>
     Thou seest, not vain the threats I bring thee:<br>
     With holy fire I'll scorch and sting thee!<br>
     Wait not to know<br>
     The threefold dazzling glow!<br>
     Wait not to know<br>
     The strongest art within my hands!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>(<i>while the vapor is dissipating, steps forth from behind the<br>
     stove, in the costume of a Travelling Scholar</i>.)<br>
     Why such a noise? What are my lord's commands?</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>This was the poodle's real core,<br>
     A travelling scholar, then? The <i>casus</i> is diverting.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>The learned gentleman I bow before:<br>
     You've made me roundly sweat, that's certain!</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>What is thy name?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>A question small, it seems,<br>
     For one whose mind the Word so much despises;<br>
     Who, scorning all external gleams,<br>
     The depths of being only prizes.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>With all you gentlemen, the name's a test,<br>
     Whereby the nature usually is expressed.<br>
     Clearly the latter it implies<br>
     In names like Beelzebub, Destroyer, Father of Lies.<br>
     Who art thou, then?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Part of that Power, not understood,<br>
     Which always wills the Bad, and always works the Good.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>What hidden sense in this enigma lies?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>I am the Spirit that Denies!<br>
     And justly so: for all things, from the Void<br>
     Called forth, deserve to be destroyed:<br>
     'Twere better, then, were naught created.<br>
     Thus, all which you as Sin have rated,�<br>
     Destruction,�aught with Evil blent,�<br>
     That is my proper element.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Thou nam'st thyself a part, yet show'st complete to me?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>The modest truth I speak to thee.<br>
     If Man, that microcosmic fool, can see<br>
     Himself a whole so frequently,<br>
     Part of the Part am I, once All, in primal Night,�<br>
     Part of the Darkness which brought forth the Light,<br>
     The haughty Light, which now disputes the space,<br>
     And claims of Mother Night her ancient place.<br>
     And yet, the struggle fails; since Light, howe'er it weaves,<br>
     Still, fettered, unto bodies cleaves:<br>
     It flows from bodies, bodies beautifies;<br>
     By bodies is its course impeded;<br>
     And so, but little time is needed,<br>
     I hope, ere, as the bodies die, it dies!</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>I see the plan thou art pursuing:<br>
     Thou canst not compass general ruin,<br>
     And hast on smaller scale begun.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>And truly 'tis not much, when all is done.<br>
     That which to Naught is in resistance set,�<br>
     The Something of this clumsy world,�has yet,<br>
     With all that I have undertaken,<br>
     Not been by me disturbed or shaken:<br>
     From earthquake, tempest, wave, volcano's brand,<br>
     Back into quiet settle sea and land!<br>
     And that damned stuff, the bestial, human brood,�<br>
     What use, in having that to play with?<br>
     How many have I made away with!<br>
     And ever circulates a newer, fresher blood.<br>
     It makes me furious, such things beholding:<br>
     From Water, Earth, and Air unfolding,<br>
     A thousand germs break forth and grow,<br>
     In dry, and wet, and warm, and chilly;<br>
     And had I not the Flame reserved, why, really,<br>
     There's nothing special of my own to show!</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>So, to the actively eternal<br>
     Creative force, in cold disdain<br>
     You now oppose the fist infernal,<br>
     Whose wicked clench is all in vain!<br>
     Some other labor seek thou rather,<br>
     Queer Son of Chaos, to begin!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Well, we'll consider: thou canst gather<br>
     My views, when next I venture in.<br>
     Might I, perhaps, depart at present?</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Why thou shouldst ask, I don't perceive.<br>
     Though our acquaintance is so recent,<br>
     For further visits thou hast leave.<br>
     The window's here, the door is yonder;<br>
     A chimney, also, you behold.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>I must confess that forth I may not wander,<br>
     My steps by one slight obstacle controlled,�<br>
     The wizard's-foot, that on your threshold made is.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>The pentagram prohibits thee?<br>
     Why, tell me now, thou Son of Hades,<br>
     If that prevents, how cam'st thou in to me?<br>
     Could such a spirit be so cheated?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Inspect the thing: the drawing's not completed.<br>
     The outer angle, you may see,<br>
     Is open left�the lines don't fit it.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Well,�Chance, this time, has fairly hit it!<br>
     And thus, thou'rt prisoner to me?<br>
     It seems the business has succeeded.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>The poodle naught remarked, as after thee he speeded;<br>
     But other aspects now obtain:<br>
     The Devil can't get out again.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Try, then, the open window-pane!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>For Devils and for spectres this is law:<br>
     Where they have entered in, there also they withdraw.<br>
     The first is free to us; we're governed by the second.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>In Hell itself, then, laws are reckoned?<br>
     That's well! So might a compact be<br>
     Made with you gentlemen�and binding,�surely?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>All that is promised shall delight thee purely;<br>
     No skinflint bargain shalt thou see.<br>
     But this is not of swift conclusion;<br>
     We'll talk about the matter soon.<br>
     And now, I do entreat this boon�<br>
     Leave to withdraw from my intrusion.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>One moment more I ask thee to remain,<br>
     Some pleasant news, at least, to tell me.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Release me, now! I soon shall come again;<br>
     Then thou, at will, mayst question and compel me.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>I have not snares around thee cast;<br>
     Thyself hast led thyself into the meshes.<br>
     Who traps the Devil, hold him fast!<br>
     Not soon a second time he'll catch a prey so precious.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>An't please thee, also I'm content to stay,<br>
     And serve thee in a social station;<br>
     But stipulating, that I may<br>
     With arts of mine afford thee recreation.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Thereto I willingly agree,<br>
     If the diversion pleasant be.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>My friend, thou'lt win, past all pretences,<br>
     More in this hour to soothe thy senses,<br>
     Than in the year's monotony.<br>
     That which the dainty spirits sing thee,<br>
     The lovely pictures they shall bring thee,<br>
     Are more than magic's empty show.<br>
     Thy scent will be to bliss invited;<br>
     Thy palate then with taste delighted,<br>
     Thy nerves of touch ecstatic glow!<br>
     All unprepared, the charm I spin:<br>
     We're here together, so begin!</p>

     Yet, for the threshold's magic which controlled him,<br>
     The Devil needs a rat's quick tooth.<br>

    <p>The lord of rats and eke of mice,<br>
     Of flies and bed-bugs, frogs and lice,<br>

    <span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">Thus thou pleasest me.</span><br>
     I hope we'll suit each other well;<br>
     For now, thy vapors to dispel,<br>
     I come, a squire of high degree,<br>
     In scarlet coat, with golden trimming,<br>
     A cloak in silken lustre swimming,<br>

    <p>This life of earth, whatever my attire,<br>
     Would pain me in its wonted fashion.<br>
     Too old am I to play with passion;<br>
     Too young, to be without desire.<br>

     Thou shalt abstain�renounce�refrain!<br>
     Such is the everlasting song<br>
     That in the ears of all men rings,�<br>
     That unrelieved, our whole life long,<br>
     Each hour, in passing, hoarsely sings.<br>
     In very terror I at morn awake,<br>
     Upon the verge of bitter weeping,<br>
     To see the day of disappointment break,<br>
     To no one hope of mine�not one�its promise keeping:�<br>
     That even each joy's presentiment<br>
     With wilful cavil would diminish,<br>
     With grinning masks of life prevent<br>
     My mind its fairest work to finish!<br>
     Then, too, when night descends, how anxiously<br>
     Upon my couch of sleep I lay me:<br>
     There, also, comes no rest to me,<br>
     But some wild dream is sent to fray me.<br>
     The God that in my breast is owned<br>
     Can deeply stir the inner sources;<br>
     The God, above my powers enthroned,<br>
     He cannot change external forces.<br>
     So, by the burden of my days oppressed,<br>
     Death is desired, and Life a thing unblest!</p>

     O would that I, before that spirit-power,<br>
     Ravished and rapt from life, had sunken!</p>

     The restless, ruddy gold hast thou,<br>
     That runs, quicksilver-like, one's fingers through,�<br>
     A game whose winnings no man ever knew,�<br>
     A maid that, even from my breast,<br>

     Shall stand, with all my future days agreeing?<br>
     In all its tides sweeps not the world away,<br>
     And shall a promise bind my being?<br>
     Yet this delusion in our hearts we bear:<br>
     Who would himself therefrom deliver?<br>
     Blest he, whose bosom Truth makes pure and fair!<br>
     No sacrifice shall he repent of ever.<br>
     Nathless a parchment, writ and stamped with care,<br>
     A spectre is, which all to shun endeavor.<br>
     The word, alas! dies even in the pen,<br>
     And wax and leather keep the lordship then.<br>
     What wilt from me, Base Spirit, say?�<br>
     Brass, marble, parchment, paper, clay?<br>
     The terms with graver, quill, or chisel, stated?<br>

     Fear not that I this pact shall seek to sever?<br>
     The promise that I make to thee<br>
     Is just the sum of my endeavor.<br>
     I have myself inflated all too high;<br>
     My proper place is thy estate:<br>
     The Mighty Spirit deigns me no reply,<br>
     And Nature shuts on me her gate.<br>
     The thread of Thought at last is broken,<br>
     And knowledge brings disgust unspoken.<br>
     Let us the sensual deeps explore,<br>
     To quench the fervors of glowing passion!<br>

     Through the impervious veil it wore!<br>

     In the rush and roll of Circumstance!<br>

     I take the wildering whirl, enjoyment's keenest pain,<br>
     Enamored hate, exhilarant disdain.<br>
     My bosom, of its thirst for knowledge sated,<br>
     Shall not, henceforth, from any pang be wrested,<br>
     And all of life for all mankind created<br>
     Shall be within mine inmost being tested:<br>
     The highest, lowest forms my soul shall borrow,<br>
     Shall heap upon itself their bliss and sorrow,<br>
     And thus, my own sole self to all their selves expanded,<br>

     Trust one of us, this Whole supernal<br>
     Is made but for a God's delight!<br>
     <i>He</i> dwells in splendor single and eternal,<br>

     Go, league thyself with a poet,<br>
     Give the rein to his imagination,<br>
     Then wear the crown, and show it,<br>
     Of the qualities of his creation,�<br>
     The courage of the lion's breed,<br>
     The wild stag's speed,<br>
     The Italian's fiery blood,<br>
     The North's firm fortitude!<br>
     Let him find for thee the secret tether<br>
     That binds the Noble and Mean together.<br>
     And teach thy pulses of youth and pleasure<br>
     To love by rule, and hate by measure!<br>
     I'd like, myself, such a one to see:<br>
     Sir Microcosm his name should be.<br>

     I feel, indeed, that I have made the treasure<br>
     Of human thought and knowledge mine, in vain;<br>

     No fount of newer strength is in my brain:<br>

     Before the joys of life shall pall.<br>
     Why, Zounds! Both hands and feet are, truly�<br>

     A woman's form, in beauty shining!<br>
     Can woman, then, so lovely be?<br>
     And must I find her body, there reclining,<br>
     Of all the heavens the bright epitome?<br>
     Can Earth with such a thing be mated?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>

     Then, self-contented, <i>Bravo</i>! says,<br>
     Must something clever be created.<br>
     This time, thine eyes be satiate!<br>
     I'll yet detect thy sweetheart and ensnare her,<br>

     Here meekly kissed the grandsire's withered hand.<br>
     I feel, O maid! thy very soul<br>
     Of order and content around me whisper,�<br>
     Which leads thee with its motherly control,<br>
     The cloth upon thy board bids smoothly thee unroll,<br>
     The sand beneath thy feet makes whiter, crisper.<br>
     O dearest hand, to thee 'tis given<br>
     To change this hut into a lower heaven!<br>
     And here!</p>
    <p>(<i>He lifts one of the bed-curtains</i>.)</p>
    <p>What sweetest thrill is in my blood!<br>
     Here could I spend whole hours, delaying:<br>
     Here Nature shaped, as if in sportive playing,<br>
     The angel blossom from the bud.<br>
     Here lay the child, with Life's warm essence<br>
     The tender bosom filled and fair,<br>
     And here was wrought, through holier, purer presence,<br>
     The form diviner beings wear!</p>
    <p>And I? What drew me here with power?<br>
     How deeply am I moved, this hour!<br>
     What seek I? Why so full my heart, and sore?<br>
     Miserable Faust! I know thee now no more.</p>
    <p>Is there a magic vapor here?<br>
     I came, with lust of instant pleasure,<br>
     And lie dissolved in dreams of love's sweet leisure!<br>
     Are we the sport of every changeful atmosphere?</p>
    <p>And if, this moment, came she in to me,<br>
     How would I for the fault atonement render!<br>
     How small the giant lout would be,<br>
     Prone at her feet, relaxed and tender!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Be quick! I see her there, returning.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Go! go! I never will retreat.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Here is a casket, not unmeet,<br>
     Which elsewhere I have just been earning.<br>
     Here, set it in the press, with haste!<br>
     I swear, 'twill turn her head, to spy it:<br>
     Some baubles I therein had placed,<br>
     That you might win another by it.<br>
     True, child is child, and play is play.</p>

    <p>What ails thee? What is't gripes thee, elf?<br>
     A face like thine beheld I never.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>I would myself unto the Devil deliver,<br>
     If I were not a Devil myself!</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Thy head is out of order, sadly:<br>
     It much becomes thee to be raving madly.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Just think, the pocket of a priest should get<br>
     The trinkets left for Margaret!<br>
     The mother saw them, and, instanter,<br>
     A secret dread began to haunt her.<br>
     Keen scent has she for tainted air;<br>
     She snuffs within her book of prayer,<br>
     And smells each article, to see<br>
     If sacred or profane it be;<br>
     So here she guessed, from every gem,<br>
     That not much blessing came with them.<br>
     "My child," she said, "ill-gotten good<br>
     Ensnares the soul, consumes the blood.<br>
     Before the Mother of God we'll lay it;<br>
     With heavenly manna she'll repay it!"<br>
     But Margaret thought, with sour grimace,<br>
     "A gift-horse is not out of place,<br>
     And, truly! godless cannot be<br>
     The one who brought such things to me."<br>
     A parson came, by the mother bidden:<br>
     He saw, at once, where the game was hidden,<br>
     And viewed it with a favor stealthy.<br>
     He spake: "That is the proper view,�<br>
     Who overcometh, winneth too.<br>
     The Holy Church has a stomach healthy:<br>
     Hath eaten many a land as forfeit,<br>
     And never yet complained of surfeit:<br>
     The Church alone, beyond all question,<br>
     Has for ill-gotten goods the right digestion."</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>A general practice is the same,<br>
     Which Jew and King may also claim.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Then bagged the spangles, chains, and rings,<br>
     As if but toadstools were the things,<br>
     And thanked no less, and thanked no more<br>
     Than if a sack of nuts he bore,�<br>
     Promised them fullest heavenly pay,<br>
     And deeply edified were they.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>And Margaret?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Sits unrestful still,<br>
     And knows not what she should, or will;<br>
     Thinks on the jewels, day and night,<br>
     But more on him who gave her such delight.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>The darling's sorrow gives me pain.<br>
     Get thou a set for her again!<br>
     The first was not a great display.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>O yes, the gentleman finds it all child's-play!</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Fix and arrange it to my will;<br>
     And on her neighbor try thy skill!<br>
     Don't be a Devil stiff as paste,<br>

    <p>MARGARET</p>

    <p>Joy follows woe, woe after joy comes flying.</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>Relate his life's sad close to me!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>In Padua buried, he is lying<br>
     Beside the good Saint Antony,<br>
     Within a grave well consecrated,<br>

    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>He gave you, further, no commission?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Yes, one of weight, with many sighs:<br>
     Three hundred masses buy, to save him from perdition!<br>
     My hands are empty, otherwise.</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>What! Not a pocket-piece? no jewelry?<br>
     What every journeyman within his wallet spares,<br>
     And as a token with him bears,<br>
     And rather starves or begs, than loses?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Madam, it is a grief to me;<br>
     Yet, on my word, his cash was put to proper uses.<br>
     Besides, his penitence was very sore,<br>
     And he lamented his ill fortune all the more.</p>
    <p>MARGARET</p>
    <p>Alack, that men are so unfortunate!<br>
     Surely for his soul's sake full many a prayer I'll proffer.</p>

    <p>You well deserve a speedy marriage-offer:<br>
     You are so kind, compassionate.</p>
    <p>MARGARET</p>

    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>If not a husband, then a beau for you!<br>
     It is the greatest heavenly blessing,<br>
     To have a dear thing for one's caressing.</p>
    <p>MARGARET</p>
    <p>The country's custom is not so.</p>

    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>I stood beside his bed of dying.<br>
     'Twas something better than manure,�<br>
     Half-rotten straw: and yet, he died a Christian, sure,<br>
     And found that heavier scores to his account were lying.<br>
     He cried: "I find my conduct wholly hateful!<br>
     To leave my wife, my trade, in manner so ungrateful!<br>
     Ah, the remembrance makes me die!<br>
     Would of my wrong to her I might be shriven!"</p>
    <p>MARTHA (<i>weeping</i>)</p>
    <p>The dear, good man! Long since was he forgiven.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>"Yet she, God knows! was more to blame than I."</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>He lied! What! On the brink of death he slandered?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>In the last throes his senses wandered,<br>
     If I such things but half can judge.<br>
     He said: "I had no time for play, for gaping freedom:<br>
     First children, and then work for bread to feed 'em,�<br>
     For bread, in the widest sense, to drudge,<br>
     And could not even eat my share in peace and quiet!"</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>Had he all love, all faith forgotten in his riot?<br>
     My work and worry, day and night?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Not so: the memory of it touched him quite.<br>
     Said he: "When I from Malta went away<br>
     My prayers for wife and little ones were zealous,<br>
     And such a luck from Heaven befell us,<br>
     We made a Turkish merchantman our prey,<br>
     That to the Soldan bore a mighty treasure.<br>
     Then I received, as was most fit,<br>
     Since bravery was paid in fullest measure,<br>
     My well-apportioned share of it."</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>Say, how? Say, where? If buried, did he own it?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Who knows, now, whither the four winds have blown it?<br>
     A fair young damsel took him in her care,<br>
     As he in Naples wandered round, unfriended;<br>
     And she much love, much faith to him did bear,<br>
     So that he felt it till his days were ended.</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>The villain! From his children thieving!<br>
     Even all the misery on him cast<br>
     Could not prevent his shameful way of living!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>But see! He's dead therefrom, at last.<br>
     Were I in <i>your</i> place, do not doubt me,<br>
     I'd mourn him decently a year,<br>
     And for another keep, meanwhile, my eyes about me.</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>Ah, God! another one so dear<br>
     As was my first, this world will hardly give me.<br>
     There never was a sweeter fool than mine,<br>
     Only he loved to roam and leave me,<br>
     And foreign wenches and foreign wine,<br>
     And the damned throw of dice, indeed.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Well, well! That might have done, however,<br>
     If he had only been as clever,<br>
     And treated <i>your</i> slips with as little heed.<br>
     I swear, with this condition, too,<br>
     I would, myself, change rings with you.</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>The gentleman is pleased to jest.</p>

     I know too well that my poor gossip can<br>
     Ne'er entertain such an experienced man.</p>

    <p>Alas, that trade and duty us so harry!<br>
     With what a pang one leaves so many a spot,<br>
     And dares not even now and then to tarry!</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>In young, wild years it suits your ways,<br>
     This round and round the world in freedom sweeping;<br>
     But then come on the evil days,<br>
     And so, as bachelor, into his grave a-creeping,<br>
     None ever found a thing to praise.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>I dread to see how such a fate advances.</p>

    <p>MARGARET</p>
    <p>Yes, out of sight is out of mind!<br>
     Your courtesy an easy grace is;<br>
     But you have friends in other places,<br>
     And sensibler than I, you'll find.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Trust me, dear heart! what men call sensible<br>
     Is oft mere vanity and narrowness.</p>
    <p>MARGARET</p>
    <div class="indentedss">
      <p>How so?</p>
    </div>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Ah, that simplicity and innocence ne'er know<br>
     Themselves, their holy value, and their spell!<br>
     That meekness, lowliness, the highest graces<br>
     Which Nature portions out so lovingly�</p>
    <p>MARGARET</p>
    <p>So you but think a moment's space on me,<br>
     All times I'll have to think on you, all places!</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>No doubt you're much alone?</p>
    <p>MARGARET</p>
    <p>Yes, for our household small has grown,<br>
     Yet must be cared for, you will own.<br>
     We have no maid: I do the knitting, sewing, sweeping,<br>
     The cooking, early work and late, in fact;<br>
     And mother, in her notions of housekeeping,<br>
     Is so exact!<br>
     Not that she needs so much to keep expenses down:<br>
     We, more than others, might take comfort, rather:<br>
     A nice estate was left us by my father,<br>
     A house, a little garden near the town.<br>
     But now my days have less of noise and hurry;<br>
     My brother is a soldier,<br>
     My little sister's dead.<br>
     True, with the child a troubled life I led,<br>
     Yet I would take again, and willing, all the worry,<br>
     So very dear was she.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <div class="indentedss">
      <p>An angel, if like thee!</p>
    </div>
    <p>MARGARET</p>
    <p>I brought it up, and it was fond of me.<br>
     Father had died before it saw the light,<br>
     And mother's case seemed hopeless quite,<br>
     So weak and miserable she lay;<br>
     And she recovered, then, so slowly, day by day.<br>
     She could not think, herself, of giving<br>
     The poor wee thing its natural living;<br>
     And so I nursed it all alone<br>
     With milk and water: 'twas my own.<br>
     Lulled in my lap with many a song,<br>
     It smiled, and tumbled, and grew strong.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>The purest bliss was surely then thy dower.</p>
    <p>MARGARET</p>
    <p>But surely, also, many a weary hour.<br>
     I kept the baby's cradle near<br>
     My bed at night: if 't even stirred, I'd guess it,<br>
     And waking, hear.<br>
     And I must nurse it, warm beside me press it,<br>
     And oft, to quiet it, my bed forsake,<br>
     And dandling back and forth the restless creature take,<br>
     Then at the wash-tub stand, at morning's break;<br>
     And then the marketing and kitchen-tending,<br>
     Day after day, the same thing, never-ending.<br>
     One's spirits, Sir, are thus not always good,<br>
     But then one learns to relish rest and food.</p>
    <div class="indentedss">
      <p>[<i>They pass</i>.</p>

    <p>Yes, the poor women are bad off, 'tis true:<br>
     A stubborn bachelor there's no converting.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>It but depends upon the like of you,<br>
     And I should turn to better ways than flirting.</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>Speak plainly, Sir, have you no one detected?<br>
     Has not your heart been anywhere subjected?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>The proverb says: One's own warm hearth<br>
     And a good wife, are gold and jewels worth.</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>I mean, have you not felt desire, though ne'er so slightly?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>I've everywhere, in fact, been entertained politely.</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>I meant to say, were you not touched in earnest, ever?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>One should allow one's self to jest with ladies never.</p>
    <p>MARTHA Ah, you don't understand!</p>

    <p>I was confused, the like ne'er happened me;<br>
     No one could ever speak to my discredit.<br>
     Ah, thought I, in my conduct has he read it�<br>
     Something immodest or unseemly free?<br>
     He seemed to have the sudden feeling<br>
     That with this wench 'twere very easy dealing.<br>
     I will confess, I knew not what appeal<br>
     On your behalf, here, in my bosom grew;<br>

     Hast thou thy countenance revealed in fire.<br>
     Thou gav'st me Nature as a kingdom grand,<br>
     With power to feel and to enjoy it. Thou<br>
     Not only cold, amazed acquaintance yield'st,<br>
     But grantest, that in her profoundest breast<br>
     I gaze, as in the bosom of a friend.<br>
     The ranks of living creatures thou dost lead<br>
     Before me, teaching me to know my brothers<br>
     In air and water and the silent wood.<br>
     And when the storm in forests roars and grinds,<br>
     The giant firs, in falling, neighbor boughs<br>
     And neighbor trunks with crushing weight bear down,<br>
     And falling, fill the hills with hollow thunders,�<br>
     Then to the cave secure thou leadest me,<br>
     Then show'st me mine own self, and in my breast<br>
     The deep, mysterious miracles unfold.<br>
     And when the perfect moon before my gaze<br>
     Comes up with soothing light, around me float<br>
     From every precipice and thicket damp<br>
     The silvery phantoms of the ages past,<br>
     And temper the austere delight of thought.</p>
    <p>That nothing can be perfect unto Man<br>
     I now am conscious. With this ecstasy,<br>
     Which brings me near and nearer to the Gods,<br>
     Thou gav'st the comrade, whom I now no more<br>
     Can do without, though, cold and scornful, he<br>
     Demeans me to myself, and with a breath,<br>
     A word, transforms thy gifts to nothingness.<br>
     Within my breast he fans a lawless fire,<br>
     Unwearied, for that fair and lovely form:<br>

    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Poor Son of Earth, how couldst thou thus alone<br>
     Have led thy life, bereft of me?<br>
     I, for a time, at least, have worked thy cure;<br>
     Thy fancy's rickets plague thee not at all:<br>
     Had I not been, so hadst thou, sure,<br>
     Walked thyself off this earthly ball<br>
     Why here to caverns, rocky hollows slinking,<br>
     Sit'st thou, as 'twere an owl a-blinking?<br>
     Why suck'st, from sodden moss and dripping stone,<br>
     Toad-like, thy nourishment alone?<br>
     A fine way, this, thy time to fill!<br>
     The Doctor's in thy body still.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>What fresh and vital forces, canst thou guess,<br>
     Spring from my commerce with the wilderness?<br>
     But, if thou hadst the power of guessing,<br>
     Thou wouldst be devil enough to grudge my soul the blessing.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>A blessing drawn from supernatural fountains!<br>
     In night and dew to lie upon the mountains;<br>
     All Heaven and Earth in rapture penetrating;<br>
     Thyself to Godhood haughtily inflating;<br>
     To grub with yearning force through Earth's dark marrow,<br>
     Compress the six days' work within thy bosom narrow,�<br>
     To taste, I know not what, in haughty power,<br>
     Thine own ecstatic life on all things shower,<br>
     Thine earthly self behind thee cast,<br>
     And then the lofty instinct, thus�</p>

    <p>Shame on thee!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Yes, thou findest that unpleasant!<br>
     Thou hast the moral right to cry me "shame!" at present.<br>
     One dares not that before chaste ears declare,<br>
     Which chaste hearts, notwithstanding, cannot spare;<br>
     And, once for all, I grudge thee not the pleasure<br>
     Of lying to thyself in moderate measure.<br>
     But such a course thou wilt not long endure;<br>
     Already art thou o'er-excited,<br>
     And, if it last, wilt soon be plighted<br>
     To madness and to horror, sure.<br>
     Enough of that! Thy love sits lonely yonder,<br>
     By all things saddened and oppressed;<br>
     Her thoughts and yearnings seek thee, tenderer, fonder,�<br>
     mighty love is in her breast.<br>
     First came thy passion's flood and poured around her<br>
     As when from melted snow a streamlet overflows;<br>
     Thou hast therewith so filled and drowned her,<br>
     That now <i>thy</i> stream all shallow shows.<br>
     Methinks, instead of in the forests lording,<br>
     The noble Sir should find it good,<br>
     The love of this young silly blood<br>
     At once to set about rewarding.<br>
     Her time is miserably long;<br>
     She haunts her window, watching clouds that stray<br>
     O'er the old city-wall, and far away.<br>
     "Were I a little bird!" so runs her song,<br>
     Day long, and half night long.<br>
     Now she is lively, mostly sad,<br>
     Now, wept beyond her tears;<br>
     Then again quiet she appears,�Always<br>
     love-mad.</p>

     Nor the desire for her sweet body bring<br>
     Again before my half-distracted senses!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>What wouldst thou, then? She thinks that thou art flown;<br>
     And half and half thou art, I own.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Yet am I near, and love keeps watch and ward;<br>
     Though I were ne'er so far, it cannot falter:<br>
     I envy even the Body of the Lord<br>
     The touching of her lips, before the altar.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>'Tis very well! <i>My</i> envy oft reposes<br>
     On your twin-pair, that feed among the roses.</p>

    <p>Away, thou pimp!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>You rail, and it is fun to me.<br>
     The God, who fashioned youth and maid,<br>
     Perceived the noblest purpose of His trade,<br>
     And also made their opportunity.<br>
     Go on! It is a woe profound!<br>
     'Tis for your sweetheart's room you're bound,<br>
     And not for death, indeed.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>What are, within her arms, the heavenly blisses?<br>
     Though I be glowing with her kisses,<br>
     Do I not always share her need?<br>
     I am the fugitive, all houseless roaming,<br>
     The monster without air or rest,<br>
     That like a cataract, down rocks and gorges foaming,<br>
     Leaps, maddened, into the abyss's breast!<br>
     And side-wards she, with young unwakened senses,<br>
     Within her cabin on the Alpine field<br>
     Her simple, homely life commences,<br>
     Her little world therein concealed.<br>
     And I, God's hate flung o'er me,<br>
     Had not enough, to thrust<br>
     The stubborn rocks before me<br>
     And strike them into dust!<br>
     She and her peace I yet must undermine:<br>
     Thou, Hell, hast claimed this sacrifice as thine!<br>
     Help, Devil! through the coming pangs to push me;<br>
     What must be, let it quickly be!<br>
     Let fall on me her fate, and also crush me,�<br>
     One ruin whelm both her and me!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Again it seethes, again it glows!<br>
     Thou fool, go in and comfort her!<br>
     When such a head as thine no outlet knows,<br>
     It thinks the end must soon occur.<br>
     Hail him, who keeps a steadfast mind!<br>
     Thou, else, dost well the devil-nature wear:<br>
     Naught so insipid in the world I find<br>
     As is a devil in despair.</p>

    <p>VALENTINE (<i>a soldier</i>, MARGARET'S <i>brother</i>)</p>
    <p><span id="first">W</span>hen I have sat at some carouse.<br>
     Where each to each his brag allows,<br>
     And many a comrade praised to me<br>
     His pink of girls right lustily,<br>
     With brimming glass that spilled the toast,<br>
     And elbows planted as in boast:<br>
     I sat in unconcerned repose,<br>
     And heard the swagger as it rose.<br>
     And stroking then my beard, I'd say,<br>
     Smiling, the bumper in my hand:<br>
     "Each well enough in her own way.<br>
     But is there one in all the land<br>
     Like sister Margaret, good as gold,�<br>
     One that to her can a candle hold?"<br>
     Cling! clang! "Here's to her!" went around<br>
     The board: "He speaks the truth!" cried some;<br>
     "In her the flower o' the sex is found!"<br>
     And all the swaggerers were dumb.<br>
     And now!�I could tear my hair with vexation.<br>
     And dash out my brains in desperation!<br>
     With turned-up nose each scamp may face me,<br>
     With sneers and stinging taunts disgrace me,<br>
     And, like a bankrupt debtor sitting,<br>
     A chance-dropped word may set me sweating!<br>
     Yet, though I thresh them all together,<br>
     I cannot call them liars, either.</p>
    <p>But what comes sneaking, there, to view?<br>
     If I mistake not, there are two.<br>
     If <i>he's</i> one, let me at him drive!<br>
     He shall not leave the spot alive.</p>
    <p>FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>How from the window of the sacristy<br>
     Upward th'eternal lamp sends forth a glimmer,<br>
     That, lessening side-wards, fainter grows and dimmer,<br>
     Till darkness closes from the sky!<br>
     The shadows thus within my bosom gather.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>I'm like a sentimental tom-cat, rather,<br>
     That round the tall fire-ladders sweeps,<br>
     And stealthy, then, along the coping creeps:<br>
     Quite virtuous, withal, I come,<br>
     A little thievish and a little frolicsome.<br>
     I feel in every limb the presage<br>
     Forerunning the grand Walpurgis-Night:<br>
     Day after to-morrow brings its message,<br>
     And one keeps watch then with delight.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, may not the treasure risen be,<br>
     Which there, behind, I glimmering see?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Shalt soon experience the pleasure,<br>
     To lift the kettle with its treasure.<br>
     I lately gave therein a squint�<br>
     Saw splendid lion-dollars in 't.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Not even a jewel, not a ring,<br>
     To deck therewith my darling girl?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>I saw, among the rest, a thing<br>
     That seemed to be a chain of pearl.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>That's well, indeed! For painful is it<br>
     To bring no gift when her I visit.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Thou shouldst not find it so annoying,<br>
     Without return to be enjoying.<br>
     Now, while the sky leads forth its starry throng,<br>
     Thou'lt hear a masterpiece, no work completer:<br>
     I'll sing her, first, a moral song,<br>
     The surer, afterwards, to cheat her.</p>

     Thou'rt also free to all the town.<br>

     And then they draw the veil of night<br>
     Over her head and ears;<br>
     Her life, in fact, they're loath to spare her.<br>
     But let her growth and strength display,<br>
     She walks abroad unveiled by day,<br>
     Yet is not grown a whit the fairer.<br>
     The uglier she is to sight,<br>
     The more she seeks the day's broad light.<br>
     The time I verily can discern<br>
     When all the honest folk will turn<br>
     From thee, thou jade! and seek protection<br>
     As from a corpse that breeds infection.<br>
     Thy guilty heart shall then dismay thee.<br>
     When they but look thee in the face:�<br>
     Shalt not in a golden chain array thee,<br>
     Nor at the altar take thy place!<br>
     Shalt not, in lace and ribbons flowing,<br>
     Make merry when the dance is going!<br>
     But in some corner, woe betide thee!<br>
     Among the beggars and cripples hide thee;<br>
     And so, though even God forgive,<br>
     On earth a damned existence live!</p>
    <p>MARTHA</p>
    <p>Commend your soul to God for pardon,<br>
     That you your heart with slander harden!</p>

    <p>MARGARET</p>
    <p>My brother! This is Hell's own pain!</p>
    <p>VALENTINE</p>
    <p>I tell thee, from thy tears refrain!<br>
     When thou from honor didst depart<br>
     It stabbed me to the very heart.<br>
     Now through the slumber of the grave<br>
     I go to God as a soldier brave.</p>

    <p><span id="first">D</span>OST thou not wish a broomstick-steed's assistance?<br>
     The sturdiest he-goat I would gladly see:<br>
     The way we take, our goal is yet some distance.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>So long as in my legs I feel the fresh existence.<br>
     This knotted staff suffices me.<br>
     What need to shorten so the way?<br>
     Along this labyrinth of vales to wander,<br>
     Then climb the rocky ramparts yonder,<br>
     Wherefrom the fountain flings eternal spray,<br>
     Is such delight, my steps would fain delay.<br>
     The spring-time stirs within the fragrant birches,<br>
     And even the fir-tree feels it now:<br>
     Should then our limbs escape its gentle searches?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>I notice no such thing, I vow!<br>
     'Tis winter still within my body:<br>
     Upon my path I wish for frost and snow.<br>
     How sadly rises, incomplete and ruddy,<br>
     The moon's lone disk, with its belated glow,<br>
     And lights so dimly, that, as one advances,<br>
     At every step one strikes a rock or tree!<br>
     Let us, then, use a Jack-o'-lantern's glances:<br>
     I see one yonder, burning merrily.<br>
     Ho, there! my friend! I'll levy thine attendance:<br>
     Why waste so vainly thy resplendence?<br>
     Be kind enough to light us up the steep!</p>
    <p>WILL-O'-THE-WISP</p>
    <p>My reverence, I hope, will me enable<br>
     To curb my temperament unstable;<br>
     For zigzag courses we are wont to keep.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Indeed? he'd like mankind to imitate!<br>
     Now, in the Devil's name, go straight,<br>
     Or I'll blow out his being's flickering spark!</p>
    <p>WILL-O'-THE-WISP</p>
    <p>You are the master of the house, I mark,<br>
     And I shall try to serve you nicely.<br>
     But then, reflect: the mountain's magic-mad to-day,<br>
     And if a will-o'-the-wisp must guide you on the way,<br>
     You mustn't take things too precisely.</p>

    toiling,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Fright us, weirdest links uncoiling</span><br>

    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And the fire-flies wink and darkle,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Crowded swarms that soar and sparkle,</span><br>

     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Or if further we're ascending?</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">All is turning, whirling, blending,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Trees and rocks with grinning faces,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Wandering lights that spin in mazes,</span><br>

    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>How strangely glimmers through the hollows<br>
     A dreary light, like that of dawn!<br>
     Its exhalation tracks and follows<br>
     The deepest gorges, faint and wan.<br>
     Here steam, there rolling vapor sweepeth;<br>
     Here burns the glow through film and haze:<br>
     Now like a tender thread it creepeth,<br>
     Now like a fountain leaps and plays.<br>
     Here winds away, and in a hundred<br>
     Divided veins the valley braids:<br>
     There, in a corner pressed and sundered,<br>
     Itself detaches, spreads and fades.<br>
     Here gush the sparkles incandescent<br>
     Like scattered showers of golden sand;�<br>

    <p>Has not Sir Mammon grandly lighted<br>
     His palace for this festal night?<br>
     'Tis lucky thou hast seen the sight;<br>
     The boisterous guests approach that were invited.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>How raves the tempest through the air!<br>
     With what fierce blows upon my neck 'tis beating!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Under the old ribs of the rock retreating,<br>
     Hold fast, lest thou be hurled down the abysses there!<br>
     The night with the mist is black;<br>
     Hark! how the forests grind and crack!<br>
     Frightened, the owlets are scattered:<br>
     Hearken! the pillars are shattered.<br>
     The evergreen palaces shaking!<br>
     Boughs are groaning and breaking,<br>
     The tree-trunks terribly thunder,<br>
     The roots are twisting asunder!<br>
     In frightfully intricate crashing<br>
     Each on the other is dashing,<br>
     And over the wreck-strewn gorges<br>
     The tempest whistles and surges!<br>
     Hear'st thou voices higher ringing?<br>
     Far away, or nearer singing?<br>
     Yes, the mountain's side along,<br>
     Sweeps an infuriate glamouring song!</p>
    <p>WITCHES (<i>in chorus</i>)</p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The witches ride to the Brocken's
    top,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The stubble is yellow, and green the
    crop.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">There gathers the crowd for carnival:</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Sir Urian sits over all.</span><br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And so they go over stone and stock;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The witch she��-s, and��-s

     A VOICE<br>

     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Alone, old Baubo's coming now;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">She rides upon a farrow-sow.</span><br>

    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Then honor to whom the honor is due!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Dame Baubo first, to lead the crew!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A tough old sow and the mother
    thereon,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Then follow the witches, every one.</span><br>

    <p>Which way com'st thou hither?</p>
    <p>VOICE</p>
    <p>O'er the Ilsen-stone.<br>
     I peeped at the owl in her nest alone:<br>
     How she stared and glared!</p>
    <p>VOICE</p>
    <p>Betake thee to Hell!<br>
     Why so fast and so fell?</p>
    <p>VOICE</p>
    <p>She has scored and has flayed me:<br>
     See the wounds she has made me!</p>
    <p>WITCHES (<i>chorus</i>)</p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The way is wide, the way is long:</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">See, what a wild and crazy throng!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The broom it scratches, the fork it
    thrusts,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The child is stifled, the mother

     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">We do not measure with such care:</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Woman in thousand steps is theft.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">But howsoe'er she hasten may,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Man in one leap has cleared the way.</span><br>

    <p>Halt, there! Ho, there!</p>
    <p>VOICE (<i>from above</i>)</p>
    <p>Who calls from the rocky cleft below there?</p>
    <p>VOICE (<i>below</i>)</p>
    <p>Take me, too! take me, too!<br>
     I'm climbing now three hundred years,<br>
     And yet the summit cannot see:<br>
     Among my equals I would be.</p>
    <p>BOTH CHORUSES</p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Bears the broom and bears the
    stock,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Bears the fork and bears the buck:</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Who cannot raise himself to-night</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Is evermore a ruined wight.</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>HALF-WITCH (<i>below</i>)</p>
    <p>So long I stumble, ill bestead,<br>
     And the others are now so far ahead!<br>
     At home I've neither rest nor cheer,<br>
     And yet I cannot gain them here.</p>
    <p>CHORUS OF WITCHES</p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">To cheer the witch will salve
    avail;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A rag will answer for a sail;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Each trough a goodly ship supplies;</span><br>

    <p>BOTH CHORUSES</p>
    <p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">When round the summit whirls our
    flight,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Then lower, and on the ground alight;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And far and wide the heather press</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">With witchhood's swarms of
    wantonness!</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>(<i>They settle down</i>.)</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>They crowd and push, they roar and clatter!<br>
     They whirl and whistle, pull and chatter!<br>
     They shine, and spirt, and stink, and burn!<br>
     The true witch-element we learn.<br>
     Keep close! or we are parted, in our turn,<br>
     Where art thou?</p>
    <p>FAUST (<i>in the distance</i>)</p>

    Then house-right I must use, and clear the way.<br>

     room!<br>

    <p>Here, Doctor, hold to me: in one jump we'll resume<br>
     An easier space, and from the crowd be free:<br>
     It's too much, even for the like of me.<br>
     Yonder, with special light, there's something shining clearer<br>
     Within those bushes; I've a mind to see.<br>
     Come on! we'll slip a little nearer.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Spirit of Contradiction! On! I'll follow straight.<br>
     'Tis planned most wisely, if I judge aright:<br>
     We climb the Brocken's top in the Walpurgis-Night,<br>
     That arbitrarily, here, ourselves we isolate.</p>

    <p>But see, what motley flames among the heather!<br>
     There is a lively club together:<br>
     In smaller circles one is not alone.</p>

    <p>Better the summit, I must own:<br>
     There fire and whirling smoke I see.<br>
     They seek the Evil One in wild confusion:<br>
     Many enigmas there might find solution.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>But there enigmas also knotted be.<br>
     Leave to the multitude their riot!<br>
     Here will we house ourselves in quiet.<br>
     It is an old, transmitted trade,<br>
     That in the greater world the little worlds are made.<br>
     I see stark-nude young witches congregate,<br>
     And old ones, veiled and hidden shrewdly:<br>
     On my account be kind, nor treat them rudely!<br>
     The trouble's small, the fun is great.<br>
     I hear the noise of instruments attuning,�<br>
     Vile din! yet one must learn to bear the crooning.<br>
     Come, come along! It <i>must</i> be, I declare!<br>
     I'll go ahead and introduce thee there,<br>
     Thine obligation newly earning.<br>
     That is no little space: what say'st thou, friend?<br>
     Look yonder! thou canst scarcely see the end:<br>
     A hundred fires along the ranks are burning.<br>
     They dance, they chat, they cook, they drink, they court:<br>
     Now where, just tell me, is there better sport?</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Wilt thou, to introduce us to the revel,<br>
     Assume the part of wizard or of devil?</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>I'm mostly used, 'tis true, to go incognito,<br>
     But on a gala-day one may his orders show.<br>
     The Garter does not deck my suit,<br>
     But honored and at home is here the cloven foot.<br>
     Perceiv'st thou yonder snail? It cometh, slow and steady;<br>
     So delicately its feelers pry,<br>
     That it hath scented me already:<br>
     I cannot here disguise me, if I try.<br>
     But come! we'll go from this fire to a newer:<br>
     I am the go-between, and thou the wooer.</p>

    <p>Say, who would put his trust in nations,<br>

    <p>AUTHOR</p>
    <p>Who, now, a work of moderate sense will read?<br>

    Beware the lure within her lovely tresses,<br>

     When she succeeds therewith a youth to snare,<br>
     Not soon again she frees him from her jesses.<br>

    <p>Those two, the old one with the young one sitting,<br>
     They've danced already more than fitting.</p>

    <p>No rest to-night for young or old!<br>

    <p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A lovely dream once came to me;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">I then beheld an apple-tree,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And there two fairest apples shone:</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">They lured me so, I climbed thereon.</span><br>
    <br>
     THE FAIR ONE<br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Apples have been desired by you,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Since first in Paradise they grew;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And I am moved with joy, to know</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">That such within my garden grow.</span><br>

     MEPHISTOPHELES (<i>dancing with the old one</i>)<br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A dissolute dream once came to me:</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Therein I saw a cloven tree,</span><br>

    <p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">I offer here my best salute</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Unto the knight with cloven foot!</span><br>

    <p>PROKTOPHANTASMIST</p>
    <p>Accurs�d folk! How dare you venture thus?<br>
     Had you not, long since, demonstration<br>
     That ghosts can't stand on ordinary foundation?<br>
     And now you even dance, like one of us!</p>
    <p>THE FAIR ONE (<i>dancing</i>)</p>
    <p>Why does he come, then, to our ball?</p>
    <p>FAUST (<i>dancing</i>)</p>
    <p>O, everywhere on him you fall!<br>
     When others dance, he weighs the matter:<br>
     If he can't every step bechatter,<br>
     Then 'tis the same as were the step not made;<br>
     But if you forwards go, his ire is most displayed.<br>
     If you would whirl in regular gyration<br>
     As he does in his dull old mill,<br>
     He'd show, at any rate, good-will,�<br>
     Especially if you heard and heeded his hortation.</p>
    <p>PROKTOPHANTASMIST</p>
    <p>You still are here? Nay, 'tis a thing unheard!<br>
     Vanish, at once! We've said the enlightening word.<br>
     The pack of devils by no rules is daunted:<br>
     We are so wise, and yet is Tegel haunted.<br>
     To clear the folly out, how have I swept and stirred!<br>
     Twill ne'er be clean: why, 'tis a thing unheard!</p>
    <p>THE FAIR ONE</p>
    <p>Then cease to bore us at our ball!</p>
    <p>PROKTOPHANTASMIST</p>
    <p>I tell you, spirits, to your face,<br>
     I give to spirit-despotism no place;<br>
     My spirit cannot practise it at all.</p>
    <p>(<i>The dance continues</i>)</p>
    <p>Naught will succeed, I see, amid such revels;<br>
     Yet something from a tour I always save,<br>
     And hope, before my last step to the grave,<br>
     To overcome the poets and the devils.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>He now will seat him in the nearest puddle;<br>
     The solace this, whereof he's most assured:<br>
     And when upon his rump the leeches hang and fuddle,<br>
     He'll be of spirits and of Spirit cured.</p>
    <p>(<i>To</i> FAUST, <i>who has left the dance</i>:)</p>
    <p>Wherefore forsakest thou the lovely maiden,<br>
     That in the dance so sweetly sang?</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Ah! in the midst of it there sprang<br>
     A red mouse from her mouth�sufficient reason.</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>That's nothing! One must not so squeamish be;<br>
     So the mouse was not gray, enough for thee.<br>
     Who'd think of that in love's selected season?</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Then saw I�.</p>

      <p>Mephisto, seest thou there,<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    Alone and far, a girl most pale and fair?<br>
     She falters on, her way scarce knowing,<br>
     As if with fettered feet that stay her going.<br>
     I must confess, it seems to me<br>
     As if my kindly Margaret were she.<br>
    <br>

    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Let the thing be! All thence have evil drawn:<br>
     It is a magic shape, a lifeless eidolon.<br>
     Such to encounter is not good:<br>
     Their blank, set stare benumbs the human blood,<br>
     And one is almost turned to stone.<br>
     Medusa's tale to thee is known.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>Forsooth, the eyes they are of one whom, dying,<br>
     No hand with loving pressure closed;<br>
     That is the breast whereon I once was lying,�<br>
     The body sweet, beside which I reposed!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Tis magic all, thou fool, seduced so easily!<br>
     Unto each man his love she seems to be.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>The woe, the rapture, so ensnare me,<br>
     That from her gaze I cannot tear me!<br>
     And, strange! around her fairest throat<br>
     A single scarlet band is gleaming,<br>
     No broader than a knife-blade seeming!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>Quite right! The mark I also note.<br>
     Her head beneath her arm she'll sometimes carry;<br>
     Twas Perseus lopped it, her old adversary.<br>
     Thou crav'st the same illusion still!<br>
     Come, let us mount this little hill;<br>
     The Prater shows no livelier stir,<br>
     And, if they've not bewitched my sense,<br>
     I verily see a theatre.<br>

    A new performance�'tis the last of seven.<br>

    <p>HENNINGS</p>
    <p>How, in crowds together massed,<br>
     They are jesting, shameless!<br>
     They will even say, at last,<br>
     That their hearts are blameless.</p>
    <p>MUSAGETES</p>
    <p>Among this witches' revelry<br>
     His way one gladly loses;<br>

    <p>Say, who's the stiff and pompous man?<br>
     He walks with haughty paces:<br>
     He snuffles all he snuffle can:<br>
     "He scents the Jesuits' traces."</p>
    <p>CRANE</p>
    <p>Both clear and muddy streams, for me<br>
     Are good to fish and sport in:<br>
     And thus the pious man you see<br>
     With even devils consorting.</p>
    <p>WORLDLING</p>
    <p>Yes, for the pious, I suspect,<br>
     All instruments are fitting;<br>

     Full many a place of meeting.</p>

     "Don't be disturbed! 'tis, in the reeds,<br>
     The bittern's changeless booming."</p>
    <p>DANCING-MASTER</p>
    <p>How each his legs in nimble trip<br>

     The crooked jump, the heavy skip,<br>
     Nor care for the appearance.</p>
    <p>GOOD FELLOW</p>
    <p>The rabble by such hate are held,<br>
     To maim and slay delights them:<br>
     As Orpheus' lyre the brutes compelled,<br>
     The bagpipe here unites them.</p>
    <p>DOGMATIST</p>
    <p>I'll not be led by any lure<br>
     Of doubts or critic-cavils:<br>
     The Devil must be something, sure,�<br>
     Or how should there be devils?</p>
    <p>IDEALIST</p>
    <p>This once, the fancy wrought in me<br>
     Is really too despotic:<br>
     Forsooth, if I am all I see,<br>
     I must be idiotic!</p>
    <p>REALIST</p>
    <p>This racking fuss on every hand,<br>
     It gives me great vexation;<br>
     And, for the first time, here I stand<br>
     On insecure foundation.</p>
    <p>SUPERNATURALIST</p>
    <p>With much delight I see the play,<br>
     And grant to these their merits,<br>
     Since from the devils I also may<br>
     Infer the better spirits.</p>
    <p>SCEPTIC</p>
    <p>The flame they follow, on and on,<br>

     God help us! that is done with:<br>
     Our shoes are all danced out, we trow,<br>
     We've but naked soles to run with.</p>
    <p>WILL-O'-THE WISPS</p>

     Yet in the ranks, at once, we're here<br>

     that the guilt of blood, from thy hand, still lies upon the town!<br>
     Avenging spirits hover over the spot where the victim fell, and<br>
     lie in wait for the returning murderer.</p>
    <p>FAUST</p>
    <p>That, too, from thee? Murder and death of a world upon<br>
     thee, monster! Take me thither, I say, and liberate her!</p>
    <p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
    <p>I will convey thee there; and hear, what I can do! Have I<br>
     all the power in Heaven and on Earth? I will becloud the<br>
     jailer's senses: get possession of the key, and lead her forth with<br>
     human hand! I will keep watch: the magic steeds are ready,<br>
     I will carry you off. So much is in my power.</p>

     Nobody else will lie beside me!�<br>
     Ah, within thine arms to hide me,<br>
     That was a sweet and a gracious bliss,<br>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
