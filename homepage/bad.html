<h2> Who  I am</h2>

<p align="right"> <img src="vk.jpg" alt="Vlad's Picture" align="left" class = "imgcenter">My name is Vlad Kravchenko and I am currently a student at the University of Alberta.
  I will graduate this semester with a bachelor of Science degree majoring in Computing Science and Psychology.

  </p>
  <p>

    <span> </span>For my first major I  concentrated on Cognitive Psychology which is the field of psychology studying mental
  precesses such as attention, perception, memory, problem solving and thinking. I have also completed a number
  of courses in Social/Personality Psychology and conducted a number of meta-Analysis studies
  on neuropharmacology of Alzheimer's disease.
</p>
  <p>
    <span> </span>My second major is Computing Science where I have completed a number of courses in Database Management, Machine Learning, Computer Networks nad Operating System Concepts.
    During my studies I learned languages such as Python, Java, C, SQL and a number of useful algorithms as well as their implementation using the languages mentioned earlier.
    I am also familiar with the software development process. During current semester I am learning html, css and javascript, further discovering intelligent systems, as well as the foundations
    of program analysis.

  <h2 id ="offer"> Why should you hire me </h2>
<p> Over the last few years I held a number of jobs which required strong leadership skills, good time management skills and comfort workingn under pressure. Some of the jobs required strong planning skills
  as well as strong analytical skills. During my studies I was introduced to a number of programming languages as well as the appliaction of specific libraries for different settings. A number of courses tought
  me the theoretical parts of the useful algorithms, but their implementation was left to self-study, which led to improving my skills searching for necessary information using WWW
  and other resources provided by university.
