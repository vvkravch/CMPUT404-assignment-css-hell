Assignment: CSS Hell
====================
Part 1:
Since many of the files in Gutenberg project have some reasonable css formatting, most of the original format was kept. Only sone of the files had images in them, which were themed. 
The body of the files were themed to look like old paper by using gradient and different shades of yellow and brown.
Some of the items were aligned to be in the center.
The font-style was changed to be serif.
Styling and colour of a number of headers was adjusted for a better feel given the background.
Faust by J. Goethe had a large number of styles implemented originally which I did nont remove due to the format of the book. I have styled the images, and added mirror images for the pictures when hovered over to add the feel of mysticism of this book.
The html files received minimal modifications. An extra class was added to style the first letter of each chapter.
Some of the styling was removed from the original html files if they conflicted with the new css theme.
The links in the content were modified to work offline.
All the references to the  original sources of css styling are mentioned in the css files.
